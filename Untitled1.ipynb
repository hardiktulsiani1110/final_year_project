    "       Scientists say they have discovered a new species of orangutans on Indonesia’s island of Sumatra.\n",
    "The population differs in several ways from the two existing orangutan species found in Sumatra and the neighboring island of Borneo.\n",
    "The orangutans were found inside North Sumatra’s Batang Toru forest, the science publication Current Biology reported.\n",
    "Researchers named the new species the Tapanuli orangutan. They say the animals are considered a new species because of genetic, skeletal and tooth differences.\n",
    "Michael Kruetzen is a geneticist with the University of Zurich who has studied the orangutans for several years. He said he was excited to be part of the unusual discovery of a new great ape in the present day. He noted that most great apes are currently considered endangered or severely endangered.\n",
    "Gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos also belong to the great ape species.\n",
    "Orangutan – which means person of the forest in the Indonesian and Malay languages - is the world’s biggest tree-living mammal. The orange-haired animals can move easily among the trees because their arms are longer than their legs. They live more lonely lives than other great apes, spending a lot of time sleeping and eating fruit in the forest.\n",
    "The new study said fewer than 800 of the newly-described orangutans exist. Their low numbers make the group the most endangered of all the great ape species.\n",
    "They live within an area covering about 1,000 square kilometers. The population is considered highly vulnerable. That is because the environment which they depend on is greatly threatened by development.\n",
    "Researchers say if steps are not taken quickly to reduce the current and future threats, the new species could become extinct “within our lifetime.”\n",
    "Research into the new species began in 2013, when an orangutan protection group in Sumatra found an injured orangutan in an area far away from the other species. The adult male orangutan had been beaten by local villagers and died of his injuries. The complete skull was examined by researchers.\n",
    "Among the physical differences of the new species are a notably smaller head and frizzier hair. The Tapanuli orangutans also have a different diet and are found only in higher forest areas.\n",
    "There is no unified international system for recognizing new species. But to be considered, discovery claims at least require publication in a major scientific publication.\n",
    "Russell Mittermeier is head of the primate specialist group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. He called the finding a “remarkable discovery.” He said it puts responsibility on the Indonesian government to help the species survive.\n",
    "Matthew Nowak is one of the writers of the study. He told the Associated Press that there are three groups of the Tapanuli orangutans that are separated by non-protected land.He said forest land needs to connect the separated groups.\n",
    "In addition, the writers of the study are recommending that plans for a hydropower center in the area be stopped by the government.\n",
    "It also recommended that remaining forest in the Sumatran area where the orangutans live be protected.\n",

    "A. \"Welfare of the Child\": Historical Evolution 1.4.1 Traditionally at Common law, the father was\n",
    "considered the sole guardian of the person and property of the child. The authority of the father in\n",
    "every aspect of the child's life, including his/her conduct, education, religion and maintenance, was\n",
    "considered absolute and even the courts refused to interfere with the same. Mothers did not have\n",
    "any authority over children, since mothers did not have independent legal status; their identities\n",

    "began to have independent legal existence and residence, their claim, if not right, to have custody of\n",
    "the children began to be recognized by the courts. However, despite a series of legislations - starting\n",
    "with the Custody of Infants Act, 1839, in the UK - that enabled the mother to claim custody over\n",
    "minor children, the rights of the father continued to remain supreme.\n",
    "1.4.2 Two developments aided in the dismantling of paternal authority over children under English\n",
    "law. First, in a number of judicial decisions, the courts claimed the parens patriae jurisdiction - an\n",
    "even higher parental authority of the state - to supersede the natural guardianship of the father and\n",
    "award custody depending on what promoted the welfare of the child.4 Second, through a series of\n",

    "rights of the mother over custody, access and appointment of testamentary guardian, and allowed\n",
    "the court to appoint and remove guardians in certain circumstances. The Guardianship of Infants\n",
    "Act, 1925, put the claims of the mother and the father in a custody dispute on an equal footing and\n",

    "continued the legacy of Common law, of the supremacy of the paternal right in guardianship and\n",
    "custody of children. While Sections 7 and 17 of the Act provided that courts should act in\n",
    "furtherance of the welfare of the minor, Sections 19 and 25 of the original Act, subordinated the\n",
    "same to the supremacy of the father. It is only the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956,\n",
    "enacted by the independent Indian state that provides that welfare of the minor shall be the\n",

    "Committee suggested that the following considerations can be relevant: the child's views; the child's\n",
    "identity (such as sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion and beliefs, cultural identity, and\n",
    "personality); preservation of the family environment and maintaining relations (including, where\n",

    "situation of vulnerability (disability, minority status, homelessness, victim of abuse, etc.); and the\n",
    "child's right to health and right to education.11 However, there are two main criticisms of the best\n",
    "interest standard when applied to custody issues.\n",
    "1.5.3 First, it is unpredictable and information intensive. Parents who are divorcing are left guessing\n",
    "as to how the courts will make custody decisions; this can lead to unnecessary pre-court bargaining\n",
    "that may be harmful to both the child and the parents.12 This could be resolved by a more\n",
    "predictable rule-based standard, which delineates the content of the best interest standard. On the\n",
    "other hand, a rule-based standard is likely to be rigid and not consider the individual circumstances\n",
    "of each case.13 Second, the best interest of the child standard primarily focuses on the predicaments\n",
    "of the child alone and does not take into consideration the feelings and interests of the parents. The\n",
    "parents are also actors within the family who have rights and any legal framework must account for\n",
    "their welfare as well.14 Thus, it is an open question whether the best interest of the child standard is\n",
    "an adequate legal tool to resolve child custody decisions, or whether it needs to be supplemented\n",

    "Children need adequate opportunities to bond with each parent.\n",
    "Shared physical custody without shared legal custody will lead a child to believe that the parents do\n",

    "During divorce proceedings, husbands use child custody to force their wives to give up maintenance\n",

    "It is not healthy for a child to move between two homes. A stable, anchored home is the best option.\n",
    "In a patriarchal society where women and children are often harassed, ensuring the child's safety\n",
    "could be a problem.\n",

    "CHAPTER II LEGAL FRAMEWORK GOVERNING CUSTODY AND GUARDIANSHIP IN INDIA 2.1\n",
    "The law governing custody of children is closely linked with that of guardianship. Guardianship\n",
    "refers to a bundle of rights and powers that an adult has in relation to the person and property of a\n",
    "minor, while custody is a narrower concept relating to the upbringing and day-to-day care and\n",
    "control of the minor. The term 'custody' is not defined in any Indian family law, whether secular or\n",
    "religious. The term 'guardian' is defined by the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (hereinafter, GWA)\n",
    "as a \"person having the care of the person of a minor or of his property or of both his person and\n",
    "property.\" 19 Another term used by the law is 'natural guardian,' who is the person legally presumed\n",
    "to be the guardian of a minor and who is presumed to be authorized to take all decisions on behalf of\n",
    "the minor. The legal difference between custody and guardianship (or natural guardianship) can be\n",
    "illustrated by the following example: under some religious personal laws, for very young children,\n",
    "the mother is preferred to be the custodian, but the father always remains the natural guardian.\n",
    " A. Statutory Law\n",
    " (i) Guardians and Wards Act, 1890\n",
    "2.2.1 The GWA is a secular law regulating\n",
    "questions of guardianship and custody for all children within the territory of India, irrespective of\n",
    "their religion. It authorizes the District Courts to appoint guardians of § 4(2), GWA.\n",
    "the person or property of a minor, when the natural guardian as per the minor's personal law or the\n",
    "testamentary guardian appointed under a Will fails to discharge his/her duties towards the minor.\n",
    "The Act is a complete code laying down the rights and obligations of the guardians, procedure for\n",
    "their removal and replacement, and remedies for misconduct by them. It is an umbrella legislation\n",
    "that supplements the personal laws governing guardianship issues under every religion.20 Even if\n",
    "the substantive law applied to a certain case is the personal law of the parties, the procedural law\n",
    "applicable is what is laid down in the GWA.21 2.2.2 Section 7 of the GWA authorizes the court to\n",
    "appoint a guardian for the person or property or both of a minor, if it is satisfied that it is necessary\n",
    "for the 'welfare of the minor.'22 Section 17 lays down factors to be considered by the court when\n",
    "appointing guardians. 23 Section 17(1) states that courts shall be guided by what the personal law of\n",
    "the minor provides and what, in the circumstances of the case, appears to be for the 'welfare of the\n",
    "minor.'24 Section 17(2) clarifies that in determining what is for the welfare of the minor, courts shall\n",
    "consider the age, sex and religion of the minor; the character and capacity of the proposed guardian\n",
    "and how closely related the proposed guardian is to the minor; the wishes, if any, of the deceased\n",
    "parents; and any existing or previous relation of the proposed guardian with the person or property\n",

    "guardian to the person of a minor, whose father or mother is alive, and who, in the opinion of the\n",
    "court, is not unfit to be a guardian.28 The earlier Section 19(b) prevented the court from appointing\n",
    "a guardian in case the father of the minor was alive. This clause was amended by the Personal Laws\n",
    "(Amendment) Act, 2010 and was made applicable to cases where even the mother was alive, thus\n",
    "removing the preferential position of the father.29 2.2.4 Section 25 of the GWA deals with the\n",
    "authority of the guardian over the custody of the ward.30 Section 25(1) states that if a ward leaves or\n",
    "is removed from the custody of the guardian, the court can issue an order for the ward's return, if it\n",
    "is of the opinion that it is for the 'welfare of the ward' to be returned to the custody of the\n",
    "guardian.31 2.2.5 Reading the above provisions together, it can be concluded that, in appointing a\n",
    "guardian to the person or property of a minor under the GWA, courts are to be guided by concern\n",
    "for the welfare of the minor/ward. This is evident from the language of Sections 7 and 17. At the\n",

    "Court awarded custody to the mother based on the welfare principle, even though the father was not\n",
    "found unfit to be a guardian. 42 Courts have held that in deciding custody, children should not be\n",
    "uprooted from their familiar surroundings just to give effect to the father's right to natural\n",
    "guardianship. 43 In a case where the child was brought up by the maternal grandparents after the\n",

    "the order of preference to the mother vis\u0002à-vis the father, the proposition is vulnerable to challenge on several grounds. In the first place, it\n",

    "Commission in this report are captured in the Hindu Minority and Guardianship (Amendment) Bill,\n",
    "2015, and the Guardians and Wards (Amendment) Bill, 2015, which are appended to the report. The\n",

    "recommendations of the 83rd report (1980) of the Law Commission, entitled 'The Guardians and\n",
    "Wards Act, 1890 and certain provisions of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956,'149 as\n",
    "well as the 133rd report (1989) of the Law Commission, entitled 'Removal of discrimination against\n",
    "women in matters relating to guardianship and custody of minor children and elaboration of the\n",
    "welfare principles.'150 6.2 The Commission provides detailed legislative text by recommending the\n",
    "insertion of a new chapter IIA dealing with 'Custody, Child Support and Visitation Arrangements'.\n",
    "The Commission also provides specific guidelines to assist the court in deciding such matters,\n",
    "including processes to determine whether the welfare of the child is met; procedures to be followed\n",
    "during mediation; and factors to be taken into consideration when determining grants for joint\n",
    "custody. The recommendations are discussed in detail in the following pages.\n",

    "Amendments to the Hindu Minority and Guardians Act, 1956 6.3 The Law Commission\n",
    "recommends the following amendments to this Act:\n",
    "1. Section 6(a): This section lists the natural guardians of a Hindu minor, in respect of\n",
    "the minor's person and property (excluding his or her undivided interest in joint\n",
    "family property). In the case of a boy or an unmarried girl, this section clearly states\n",
    "that the natural guardian of a Hindu minor is the father, and after him the mother.\n",
    "Even after the Supreme Court's judgment in Gita Hariharan v Reserve Bank of\n",
    "India,151 the mother can become a natural guardian during the lifetime of the father\n",
    "only in exceptional circumstances. This is required to be changed to fulfil the\n",
    "principles of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution.\n",
    "Report No.257 On \"Reforms In Guardianship And Custody Laws In India\"\n",
    "Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116184888/ 32\n",
    "Accordingly, the Law Commission recommends that this superiority of one parent\n",
    "over the other should be removed, and that both the mother and the father should be\n",
    "regarded, simultaneously, as the natural guardians of a minor. This also follows from\n",
    "the recommendation of the Commission that the welfare of the minor must be the\n",
    "paramount consideration in every circumstance. This concept of welfare being\n",
    "paramount is already captured in Section 13 of the 1956 Act. In recommending such\n",
    "an amendment to Section 6, the Commission reaffirms the recommendations of its\n",
    "133rd report, to give equal rights to both the mother and father in respect of (1999) 2\n",
    "SCC 228 a minor and his/her property.152 It also reaffirms the recommendations of\n",
    "the 83rd report of the Law Commission, in intending the two provisions (Sections 6\n",
    "and 13) to be read together.153 Such a reading will necessarily imply that neither the\n",
    "father nor the mother of a minor can, as of a right, claim to be appointed by the court\n",
    "as the guardian unless such an appointment is for the welfare of the minor.\n",
    "The Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 has also undergone similar legislative changes,\n",
    "moving away from an absolute and natural right of a father to be the guardian.154\n",
    "The 1890 law was enacted at a time when women had limited rights in law, and it was\n",
    "in need of reform. According to the older version of Section 19(b) of the 1890 Act, the\n",
    "court could not appoint a guardian of a minor (other than a married female), if the\n",
    "minor's father was living and not unfit to be the guardian. The Personal Laws\n",
    "(Amendment) Act, 2010 amended this clause to refer also to the mother in the same\n",
    "vein as the father, thereby making the law more equitable. 155 The recommendations\n",
    "of the Commission, in context of the changes to the 1890 Act, therefore, are merely\n",
    "removing anomalies in one law that have already been removed in another.\n",

    "B. Amendments to the Guardians and Wards Act, 6.4 The Law Commission recommends the\n",
    "following amendments to this Act:\n",
    "1. Section 17: This section provides for matters to be considered by the court in\n",
    "appointing the guardian of a minor, and requires the welfare of a minor to be\n",
    "consistent with the laws to which the minor is subject. In the past, Section 17 was\n",
    "read with Section 19 of this Act (which deals with the preferential right of natural\n",
    "guardianship). 159 Before being amended by the Personal Laws (Amendment) Act,\n",
    "2010, Section 19 offered a preferential right to the husband (of a minor girl), or the\n",
    "father (in all other cases) to be the guardian of the minor, if neither were unfit to be\n",
    "appointed guardian. The 2010 Act included the mother along Law Commission of\n",
    "India, 83rd Report, April (1980), ¶6.40, available at\n",
    "http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/51-100/Report83.pdf with the father as a\n",
    "natural guardian of the child, and changed the position of the law slightly. 160\n",
    "However, the welfare of the child was still not, under law, truly the paramount\n",
    "consideration in such matters.\n",
    "The Law Commission recommends that the possibility of any alternate reading be\n",
    "corrected in statute, and reaffirms, in this context, the general recommendations\n",
    "made by the 83rd report of the Law Commission. Thus, in the appointment or\n",
    "declaration of a guardian, the welfare of the minor must be paramount, and\n",
    "everything else must be secondary to this consideration. In determining welfare,\n",
    "Report No.257 On \"Reforms In Guardianship And Custody Laws In India\"\n",
    "Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116184888/ 34\n",
    "however, the court may give due regard to the laws to which the minor may be\n",
    "subject. As the 83rd report observed, \"such an amendment will settle the position for\n",
    "all times to come,\" 161 and will remove the possibility of the appointment of a\n",
    "guardian without first assessing welfare.\n",
    "2. Section 19: This section provides for the preferential right of certain persons to be regarded as\n",
    "natural guardians. It provides that the court may not appoint a guardian, if the husband of a minor\n",
    "who is a married female is not unfit to be the guardian of her person, or if the father or mother (who\n",
    "are living) of a minor other than a married female is similarly not unfit to be the guardian. Here, too,\n",
    "the Commission reaffirms the 83rd report regarding the importance of the welfare principle, and\n",
    "recommends that in determining whether a person is unfit to be a guardian in these Personal Laws\n",
    "(Amendment) Act, No. 30 of 2010, chapter II.\n",

    "http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/51-100/Report83.pdf circumstances, the welfare of the minor\n",
    "under Section 17 shall be the paramount consideration.\n",
    "3. Section 25: This section provides for the arrest of a ward if the ward leaves or is removed from the\n",
    "custody of his guardian, if such arrest is for the welfare of the ward. As with its recommendations\n",
    "above, the Law Commission concurs with its 83rd report, in various aspects.162 First, the concept of\n",
    "arrest of a minor is an archaic one, and needs to be amended to reflect modern social\n",
    "considerations. Therefore, the Law Commission recommends a substitute section, replacing 'arrest'\n",
    "with the requirement to return the ward to the custody of his or her guardian. Again, the\n",
    "Commission reiterates the necessity of placing the welfare of the minor as the paramount\n",
    "consideration.\n",
    "Second, the present text of the law is unclear as to whether a guardian who has never had custody of\n",
    "a minor is entitled to the relief under this section. This needs to be clarified, and accordingly, the\n",
    "Law Commission reiterates the recommendations of the 83rd report163 as regards the language of\n",
    "the provision to specifically state that it applies in cases where the child is not in the custody of the\n",
    "guardian, though the latter is entitled to such custody.\n",
    "Third, it recommends that the court must not make an order under this section in respect of a child\n",
    "of fourteen years of over, without taking into consideration the wishes of the child.164 This is in\n",
    "consonance with the provisions of Section 17 of Id, ¶7.18 Id, ¶7.14-7.17 Id, ¶7.20 this Act, which\n",
    "allows the court to consider the stated preference of a minor, if the minor is old enough to form an\n",
    "intelligent preference. In a scenario where the minor of over fourteen years of age has left or been\n",
    "removed from the custody of his or her guardian, the Commission recommends that the court must\n",
    "take into consideration the preference of the child.\n",
    "4. Insertion of new Chapter IIA: This chapter deals with custody, child support and visitation issues,\n",
    "covering a range of topics as discussed below.\n",
    "a. Section 19A: Objectives of the chapter.\n",
    "Report No.257 On \"Reforms In Guardianship And Custody Laws In India\"\n",
    "Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116184888/ 35\n",
    "This section lays down the principal objectives of this chapter, by way of guidance to the court as to\n",
    "what the chapter seeks to achieve. Children are the most vulnerable persons in a matrimonial\n",
    "dispute, and the trauma that they face during and after the legal determination of such disputes is\n",
    "immeasurably harsh. Children often become pawns in such matters, and are used by their parents\n",
    "for their own purposes, to strike bargains that rarely take into consideration the emotional, social\n",
    "and mental upheavals that the children themselves may be facing. The Commission believes this\n",
    "imbalanced situation can be addressed in some measure through legislative changes that will place a\n",
    "duty upon the court to uphold the child's welfare in each and every circumstance, regardless of the\n",
    "individual interests of the parties involved.\n",
    "These objectives, therefore, embody the fundamental and most important recommendation of the\n",
    "Law Commission, regarding the welfare of the child being of utmost consideration. A court is bound\n",
    "to bear in mind these objectives in making an order under this chapter, and will therefore be\n",
    "required to comprehensively assess the consequences of any order it makes in light of these\n",
    "objectives.\n",
    "The objectives require that the welfare of a child is met by ensuring various other aspects, such as\n",
    "recognising the changing emotional, intellectual and physical needs of the child; maintaining a\n",
    "healthy and continuing relationship with both parents, society and siblings; recognising the prior\n",
    "and future ability and commitment of the parents to participate in the growth of the child;\n",
    "protecting the child from violence of any kind, and so on.\n",
    "b. Section 19B: Applicability of this chapter.\n",
    "Custody issues are dealt with in three personal laws, which are, the Indian Divorce Act, 1869\n",
    "(Sections 41 and 43), the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936 (Section 49), and the Hindu\n",
    "Marriage Act, 1955 (Section 26). In general terms, these sections grant the court the power to pass\n",
    "decree/ order regarding the custody, maintenance and education of minor children, whose parents\n",
    "are parties to a suit for divorce or separation.\n",
    "The new chapter IIA as recommended by the Law Commission provides for detailed considerations\n",
    "in custody matters, and in that regard, is in addition to the powers of the court as listed in the three\n",
    "personal laws. This new section clarifies that the provisions of this new chapter will apply to all\n",
    "proceedings related to custody and child support, including under the three laws. This\n",
    "cross-reference to the personal laws is provided in the statute to clarify that the recommendations of\n",
    "the Commission are intended to be secular, and applicable to all persons, regardless of the personal\n",
    "laws they may be governed by.\n",
    "c. Section 19C: Definitions.\n",
    "This section offers two key definitions, i.e., joint custody and sole custody. Joint custody is where\n",
    "both parents share physical custody of the child (in such proportion as the court determines to be\n",
    "for the welfare of the child), and also equally share the responsibility for the care and control of the\n",
    "child, and decision- making authority. Sole custody is a situation where one parent retains the\n",
    "Report No.257 On \"Reforms In Guardianship And Custody Laws In India\"\n",
    "Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116184888/ 36\n",
    "physical care and control of a child. However, these rights may be subject to the power of the court\n",
    "to grant visitation rights to the other parent.\n",
    "The introduction of joint custody as a defined term is to recognise the possibility, in law, of a court\n",
    "issuing an order of joint custody, if it is for the welfare of the child. However, the definition of joint\n",
    "custody, and the substantive provisions that follow, must always be read in light of the objectives\n",
    "that open the chapter, which seek to ensure that the custody arrangement eventually granted is\n",
    "always subject to the welfare of the child being met.\n",
    "d. Section 19D: Award of custody.\n",
    "This section gives powers to the court to make different kinds of custody orders. However, it also\n",
    "requires the court to consider the detailed guidelines contained in the schedule in this regard. The\n",
    "court retains the power to modify the orders so made, provided such modifications remain in the\n",
    "welfare of the child, and the reasons for such modification are recorded.\n",
    "e. Section 19E: Power to pass additional orders.\n",
    "This is an additional power granted to the court, necessary to effectuate or enforce any order\n",
    "relating to the custody of the child under the chapter.\n",
    "f. Section 19F: Mediation.\n",
    "Many disputes arising out of divorce proceedings (child custody, child support, etc.) could be solved\n",
    "through mediation. This would promote better outcomes for both parents and children, as well as\n",
    "reduce the strain on the overburdened court system. Before engaging directly with the court system,\n",
    "the Commission recommends that parties to a custody matter must ordinarily consider mediation\n",
    "before the proceedings actually begin, or when the court so orders. The court will usually refer the\n",
    "parents to the court-annexed mediation centre. However, in case there is no such centre, the court\n",
    "may appoint an individual mediator.\n",
    "At present, Family Courts take assistance from marriage counsellors in settling disputes.\n",
    "Counsellors are different from mediators in terms of their approach. Counselling usually requires\n",
    "identifying behavioural issues of the individual parties and tends to involve professionals trained in\n",
    "areas of mental health, psychology and sociology, unlike mediation, which requires identifying\n",
    "conflict behaviour and tends to involve professionals trained in dispute resolution. 165 Therefore,\n",
    "the Commission recommends that parties should be given the opportunity to participate in\n",
    "mediation with a trained mediator. Mediators should have appropriate background and training,\n",
    "including in family disputes. Further, High Courts, District Courts and Family Courts should\n",
    "maintain a list of court-annexed mediation centres and individual mediators. These will be\n",
    "identified and paid remuneration in accordance with a scheme designed by the concerned High\n",
    "Court in consultation with the respective state governments.\n",
    "Report No.257 On \"Reforms In Guardianship And Custody Laws In India\"\n",
    "Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116184888/ 37\n",
    "As the legislation repeatedly emphasises, it is the duty of the court to ensure that the final custody\n",
    "order is for the welfare of the child. For this purpose, the Commission recommends that the court\n",
    "should have the power to obtain an independent psychological evaluation of the child, in order to\n",
    "determine various related issues (e.g., the child's preference, influence of and relationships with the\n",
    "parents, etc.). Further, as in the case of mediation, professional assistance may be required, as\n",
    "neither the court nor mediators may be qualified to understand child psychology.\n",

    "Time-bound resolution is also a key factor to achieve the ultimate objective of ensuring that the\n",
    "welfare of the child is met. The Supreme Court has recognized that Family Courts should ensure that\n",
    "a reasonable time limit is prescribed for the completion of the entire mediation process so as to not\n",
    "delay the resolution of family disputes any further.166 The Commission recommends that any\n",
    "mediation under this section must be time-bound, and must conclude within sixty days of being so\n",
    "ordered. In the absence of such a requirement, there is a risk that mediation may continue\n",
    "indefinitely and adversely affect the child in question. However, the court can extend this period,\n",
    "where necessary.\n",
    "g. Section 19G: Child support.\n",
    "Personal laws in India deal with the concept and idea of child support to some extent through the\n",
    "concept of custody of children in codified Hindu Law167 and Parsi Law,168 and the Indian Divorce\n",

    "worded so as to be applicable to all persons entitled to claim maintenance under the various\n",
    "provisions of the 1956 Act.174 The Law Commission believes that child support in custody matters\n",
    "entails much more than the concept of maintenance as captured by the 1956 Act. Accordingly, it\n",
    "empowers the court to specifically pass orders for the maintenance of children. It elaborates that\n",
    "such an order will involve fixing an amount that is \"reasonable or necessary\" to meet the living\n",
    "expenses of the child, including food, clothing, shelter, health care, and education.\n",
    "However, terms such as \"reasonable\" and \"necessary\" may be construed as vague, and can be abused\n",
    "or wrongly interpreted when fixing amounts for child support. The Commission, therefore, qualifies\n",
    "these terms by recommending certain factors that courts must keep in mind when calculating child\n",
    "support. These include the financial resources of the parents, the standard of living of the child,175\n",
    "the physical and emotional condition of the child, his or her educational and healthcare needs or any\n",

    "this period may extend till the child reaches the age of 25, and not thereafter.\n",

    "177 The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, applies to persons with disability, but the\n",
    "benefits cease at the age of eighteen. The Commission recommends correcting the provision of law\n",
    "to provide child support beyond such time as the child reaches 25 years of age, in case of a child with\n",

    "performed on the child; d. the choice of extra-curricular activities, taking into consideration the\n",

    "that--\n",
    "a. the day-to-day needs of the child are met; b. any special needs that the child may have are met;\n",

    "i. any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental\n",
    "responsibility for the child.\n",
    "(4) The parenting plan must be voluntarily and knowingly arrived at by each parent.\n",
    "(5) The court shall not ordinarily interfere with the division of responsibilities between parents\n",
    "reflected in the parenting plan, unless they are ex facie inequitable.\n",
    "(6) If the initial parenting plan does not cover certain issues, the parents may approach the court to\n",
    "modify the terms of the plan to address new subjects of decision-making.\n",
    "IX. VISITATION (1) An order made by the court regarding visitation must ensure that--\n",
    "a. a child has frequent and continuing contact with both parents, when appropriate, and also with\n",
    "extended family and friends; and b. both parents have equal opportunites to spend quality time with\n",
    "the child, including during holidays and vacations. (2) For the purpose of determining visitation\n",

    "the child;\n",
    "Report No.257 On \"Reforms In Guardianship And Custody Laws In India\"\n",

    "b. the distance between the parental homes; c. any holidays, including weekends, festivals and\n",

    "(3) The court may decide the time, manner and place to exercise visitation rights, and may take into\n",
    "consideration any visitation rights plan that has been submitted to the court by the parents. (4) A\n",
    "court may limit, suspend, or otherwise restrict, the visitation rights granted to a parent, if the court\n",
    "has reasonable basis to believe that circumstances make such restriction necessary for the welfare of\n",
    "the child, or if there is serious or repeated breach by a parent of any duties imposed by the court in\n",
    "this regard.'''"

      "GAJENDRAGADKAR J-This is an appeal by the State of Bombay hereinafter called the appellant and two others and it arises from a writ petition filed against it by the Hospital Mazdoor Sabha a trade union registered under the Industrial Trade Unions Act XIV of 1926 and two of its members Mrs Vatsala Narayan and Mrs Ruth Isaac hereinafter called respondents I to 3 Respondents IQ and 3 were employed as Ward servants in the J J group of Hospitals The superintendent of this said group of Hospitals informed the said respondents by notices issued respectively against them that their services would be terminated with effect from the dates mentioned in the said notices and in accordance with the said notices their services were in fact terminated\n",
      "\n",
      "subsequently in their place two State servants who were discharged from the Civil Supplies Department were appointed The writ petition filed by the respondents alleged that the retrenchment of respondents 2 and 3 was void as it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of ss 25F and 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 14 of 1947 hereinafter called the Act and it claimed a writ of mandamus directing the appellant to reinstate them in their posts This petition was resisted by the appellant on several grounds It was urged that the orders terminating the services of respondents 2 and 3 were not void and so the respondents' claim for a writ was unjustified on the merits and it was argued that the writ application was wholly misconceived inasmuch as the J J group of Hospitals did not constitute an industry and so the relevant provisions of the Act were inapplicable to the respondent's case This writ petition was heard by Tendolkar J The learned judge did not think it necessary to consider what he called the somewhat ticklish question as to whether the group of Hospitals constitutes an industry because he held that even assuming that the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable and could be invoked by the respondents it was not shown that the impugned orders were void In his opinion non-compliance with the provisions of s 251' did not invalidate the said orders and it was open to the respondents to seek for an appropriate remedy under s 251 of the Act He also held that the question about the application of s 25H did not arise On these findings the writ petition filed by the respondents was dismissed The matter was then taken before the Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal held that the impugned orders had not complied with the mandatory provisions of s 25F and so they were invalid and inoperative That is why the question as to whether s 25H applied was not considered by it The finding that the impugned orders were invalid for contravention of the mandatory provisions of s 25F made it necessary to decide the larger issue as to whether the Act applied to the Hospitals The Court of Appeal has observed that it was first inclined to send the matter back to Tendolkar J but it was requested by the learned counsel appearing for both the parties that it Would be better if the said question was decided by it as it was a question of law and the decision of the said issue by the Court of Appeal would avoid a remand and a further appeal That is how the issue was considered by the Court of Appeal and answered in favour of the respondents In the result the decision of Tendolkar J was reversed the writ petition was allowed and a writ in the nature of mandamus was issued against the appellant\n",
      "\n",
      "The appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate of fitness from the Bombay High Court and with the said certificate it has brought the present appeal before us On behalf of the appellant two points have been raised for our decision in the present appeal Was the Appellate Court justifiedin holding that the contravention of the material provisions of s 25F of the Act rendered the impugned orders invalid and do the relevant provisions of the Act apply to the group of Hospitals run by the appellant are they an industry within the meaning of the Act \n",
      "\n",
      "Before dealing with these points it would be relevant to state the material facts in regard to the group of Hospitals themselves which are not in dispute This group consists of five Hospitals It appears that in 1835 Sir Robert Grant the then Governor of Bombay desired to start an institution for the purposes of imparting medical education in the Presidency of Bombay His proposal in that behalf was sanctioned by the Board of Directors of the East India Company and funds amounting to Rs 44000 were collected for the purpose and an equal amount was contributed by the Directors to defray the cost of construction of the College building 'In 1843 the foundation of the Medical College building was laid and the same was completed in 1845 About that time an idea of building a hospital for the sick people of all classes and castes was mooted and Sir Jamsetjee Jeejibboy offered donation and some contribution was made by the Government with which the J J Hospital was constructed and it was formally opened on May 15 1845 Similarly the other four Hospitals in the group were built in course of time from donations Except for a small amount of Rs 10000 the rest of the expenditure which is in the neighbourhood of Rs 27 lakhs is entirely met by the appellant out of the grant sanctioned in the budget under the bead \" 38-Medical \" The group is under the administrative control of the Surgeon- General of the appellant and its day-to-day affairs are conducted and controlled by the Superintendent who is a full time employee of the appellant the residential staff including the Resident Medical Officers Assistant Medical Officers Housemen Nurses and others are all full-time employees of the -appellant and their salaries are drawn on the establishment pay bills every month and paid entirely by the appellant This group serves as a clinical training ground for students of the Grant Medical College which is a Government Medical College run and  managed by the appellant for imparting medical sciences leading to the Degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of the Bombay University as well as various Post-Graduate qualifications of the said University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons Bombay the group is thus run and managed by the appellant to provide medical relief and to promote the health of the people of Bombay\n",
      "\n",
      "Now turning to the first point it may be stated that the facts on which the respondents' plea is based are not in dispute It is conceded that the services of respondents 2 and 3 have been retrenched though it may be for the purpose of making room for other Government servants with a longer record of service who had to be retrenched owing to the closure of the appellant'- Civil Supplies Department It is also not disputed that the said respondents had not been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation as prescribed by s 25Fb The respondents' contention is that the failure to comply with the said requirement makes the order of retrenchment invalid This plea has been upheld by the Court of Appeal Section 25F b provides that no workman employed III in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall beretrenched by that employer until he has been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days' average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months Clauses a and c of the said section prescribe similar conditions but we are not concerned with them On a plain reading of s 25F b it is clear that the requirement prescribed by it is a condition precedent for the retrenchment of the workman The section provides that no workman shall be retrenched until the condition in question has been satisfied It is difficult to accede to the argument that where the section imposes in mandatory terms a condition precedent non-compliance with the said condition would not render the impugned retrenchment invalid The argument which appealed to Tendolkar J however was that the consequence of non-compliance with the requirement of s 25F b was not to render the impugned retrenchment invalid because be thought that by s 251 a specific provision has been made for the recovery of the amount prescribed by s 25F b Section 251 provides for the recovery of monies due from employers under Ch V and according to Tendolkor J this provision covers the amount due to the workman by way of compensation under s 25F b In our opinion this view is untenable Having regard to the fact that the words used in s 25F b are mandatory and their effect is plain and unambiguous it seems to us that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that s 251 covered cases of recover of ninnies other than those specified in s 25F b an it is obvious that there are several other cases i which monies become due from the employers to th employees under Ch V it is for the recovery of the monies that s 251 had been enacted Therefore we see no substance in the argument that the Court of Appeal has misconstrued s 25F\n",
      "\n",
      "b That being so failure to comply with the said provision renders the impugned orders invalid and inoperative Does the said provision apply to the present proceedings  In other words is the Act itself applicable to the group of Hospitals with which are concerned  That is the next question which calls for an answer in the present appeal Indeed it is this general question which has been strenuously argued before us by the learned Solicitor- General on behalf of the appellant The decision of this question depends upon the interpretation of the definition of industry \" prescribed by s 2j of the Act Let us first read the definition Section 2j providies that 'industry\" means any business trade undertaking manufacture of calling of employers and includes any calling service employment handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen It would be noticed that the words used in the definition are very wide in their import and even so its latter part purports to provide an inclusive definition The word \"undertaking\" according to Webster means\" anything undertaken  any business work or project which one engages in or attempts an enterprise \" Similarly \" trade \" according to Halsbury in its primary meaning is \" exchange of goods for goods or goods for money \" and in its secondary meaning it is \" any business carried on with a view to profit whether manual or mercantile as distinguished from the liberal arts or learned professions and from agriculture \" whereas \" business \" is a wider term not synonymous with trade and means practically \" anything which is an occupation as distinguished from a pleasure The word SC calling \" again is very wide it means`one's usual occupation vocation business or trade\" so is the word \"service\" very wide in its import Prima facie if the definition has deliberately used words of such wide import it would be necessary to read those words in their wide denotation and so read Hospitals cannot be excluded from the definition\n",
      "\n",
      "It is however contended that in construing the definition we must adopt the rule of construction noscuntur a sociis This rule according to Maxwell means that when two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled toge-\n",
      "\n",
      "ther they are understood to be used in their cognate sense They take is it were their colour from each other that is the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to a less general The same rule is thus interpreted in \" Words and Phrases \" Vol XIV P 207 \" Associated words take their meaning from one another under the doctrine of noscuntur a sociis the philosophy of which is that the meaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it such doctrine is broader than the maxim Ejusdem Generis\" In fact the latter I maxim \"is only an illustration or specific application of the broader maxim noscuntur a sociis \" The argument is that certain essential features or attributes are invariably associated with the words \" business and trade \" as understood in the popular and conventional sense and it is the colour of these attributes which is taken by the other words used in the definition though their normal import may be much wider We are not impressed by this argument It must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider 1 is only where the intention of the Legislature i associating wider words with words of narrow significance is doubtful or otherwise not clear that the present rule of construction can be useful applied It can also be applied where the meaning of the words of wider import is doubtful but where the object of the Legislature in using wider words i clear and free of ambiguity the rule of construction in question cannot be pressed into service As ha been observed by Earl of Halsbury L C in The Corporation of Glasgow v Glasgow Tramway an Omnibus Co Ltd 1 in dealing with the wider word used in s 6 of Valuation of Lands Scotland Act 1854 \" the words 'free from all expenses whatever i connection with the said tramways' appear to me to be so wide in their application that I should have thought it impossible to qualify or cut them down by their being associated with other words on the 1 1898 AC 63 at p 634\n",
      "\n",
      "principle of their being ejusdem generis with the previous words enumerated \" If the object and scope -of the statute are considered there would be no difficulty in holding that the relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the Legislature in defining \" industry\" in s 2j The object of the Act was to make provision for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes and the extent and scope of its provisions would be realised if we bear in mind the definition of \" industrial dispute \" given by s 2k of \" wagesby s 2rr \" workman \" by s 2s and of \" employer by s 2g Besides the definition of public utility service prescribed by s 2m is very significant One has merely to glance at the six categories of public utility service mentioned by s 2m to realise that the rule of construction on which the appellant relies is inapplicable in interpreting the definition prescribed by s 2j\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another point which cannot be ignored Section 2j does not define \" industry \" in the usual manner by prescribing what it means the first clause of the definition gives the statutory meaning of \" industry \" and the second clause deliberately refers to several other items of industry and brings them in the definition in an inclusive way It is obvious that the words used in an inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated as restricted in any sense Vide Stroud's \" Judicial Dictionary \" Vol 2 p 1415 Where we are dealing with an inclusive definition it would be inappropriate to put a restrictive interpretation upon terms of wider denotation Besides it would be relevant to point out that too much reliance cannot be placed on what are described as the essential attributes or features of trade or business as conventionally understood The conventional meaning attributed to the words \"trade and business\" has lost some of it validity for the purpose of industrial adjudication Industrial adjudication has necessarily to be aware of the current of socioeconomic thought around it must recogiiise that in the modern welfare State healthy industrial relations are a matter of paramount import-\n",
      "\n",
      "ance and its essential function is to assist the State by helping a solution of industrial disputes which constitute a distinct and persistent phenomenon of modern ~industrialised States ~In attempting to solve industrial disputes industrial adjudication does not and should not adopt a ~doctrinnaire approach It must evolve some working principles and should generally avoid formulating or adopting abstract generalisations Nevertheless it cannot harp back to old-age notions about the relations between employer and employee or to the doctrine of laissez faire which then governed the regulation of the said relations That is why we think in construing the wide words used in s 2j it would be erroneous to attach undue importance to attributes associated with business or trade in the popular mind in days gone by\n",
      "\n",
      "It is clear however that though s 2j uses words of very wide denotation a line would have to be drawn in a fair and just manner so as to exclude some callings services or undertakings If all the words used are given their widest meaning all services and all callings would come within the purview of the definition even service rendered by a servant purely in a personal or domestic matter or even in a casual way would fall within the definition It is not and cannot be suggested that in its wide sweep the word \"service\" is intended to include service howsoever rendered in whatsoever capacity and for whatsoever reason We must therefore consider where the line should be drawn and what limitations can and should be reasonably implied in interpreting the wide words used in s 2j and that no doubt is a somewhat difficult problem to decide It is true that under the old-world notion prevailing under the capitalist form of society industry generally means an economic activity involving investment of capital systematically carried on for profit for the production or sale of goods by the employment of labour When it is urged by the appellant that an undertaking should be analogous to trade or business what is really intended is that unless the undertaking in question shares the aforesaid essential features associated with the conventional notion of trade or business it should not be treated as falling under s 2j There are two serious difficulties in accepting such a suggestion and indeed the appellant concedes the presence of these two difficulties It is not disputed that under s 2j an activity can and must be regarded as an industry even though in carrying it out profit motive may be absent It is also common ground that the absence of investment of any capital would not make a material difference to the applicability of s 2j Thus two of the important attributes conventionally associated with trade or business are not necessarily predicated in interpreting s 2j What then can be said to be the attributes or features which should be common between trade and business on the one hand and an undertaking and other items mentioned in s 2j on the other \n",
      "\n",
      "It would be possible to exclude some activities from s 2j without any difficulty Negatively stated the activities of the Government which can be properly described as regal or sovereign activities are outsidly the scope of s 2j These are functions which a constitutional Government can and must undertake for governance and which no private citizen can undertake This position is not in dispute An attempt is however made by the appellant to suggest that in view of the Directive Principles enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution and in view of the ideal of a welfare State which has been placed before the country Governments both at the level of the States as well as at the Centre undertake several welfare activities and the argument is that the field of governmental or regal activities which are excluded from the operation of s 2j should be extended to cover other activities undertaken by the Governments in pursuit of their welfare policies In our opinion this contention cannot be accepted  The activities which do not fall within s 2j and which are described as governmental or regal or sovereign have been pithily described by Lord Watson as \"the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional Government\" Vide Coomber v Justices of Berks1  and it is only these activities that are outside the scope of s 2j It sounds incongruous and self- contradictory 1 1883 App cas 61\n",
      "\n",
      "to suggest that activities undertaken by the Government in the interests of socioeconomic progress of the country as beneficial measures should be exempted from the operation of the Act which in substance is a very important beneficial measure itself In this connection it would be relevant to point out that the definition of the word \"employer\" given by s 2g is not without significance an \"employer\" means under s 2gi \"in relation to an industry carried on by or under the authority of any department of the Central Government or State Government authority prescribed in this behalf or where no authority is prescribed the head of the department\" This definition clearly indicates that the Legislature intended the application of the Act to activities of the Government which fall within s 2j In considering the question as to whether the group of Hospitals run by the appellant undoubtedly for the purpose of giving medical relief to the citizens and for helping to impart medical education are an undertaking or not it would be pertinent to enquire whether an activity of a like nature would be an undertaking if it is carried on by a private citizen or a group of private citizens There is no doubt that if a hospital is run by private citizens for profit it would be an undertaking very much like the trade or business in their conventional sense We have already stated that the presence of profit motive is not essential for bringing an undertaking within s 2 j If that be so if a private citizen runs a hospital without charging any fees from the patients treated in it would nevertheless be an undertaking under s 2j Thus the character of the activity involved in running a hospital brings the institution of the hospital within s 2j Does it make any difference that the hospital is run by the Government in the interpretation of the word \"undertaking\" in s 2j  In our opinion the answer to this question must be in the negative It is the character of the activity which decides the question as to whether the activity in question attracts the provision of s 2j who conducts the activity and whether it is conducted for profit or not do not make a material difference\n",

      "We have yet to decide which are the attributes the presence of which makes in activity an under taking within s 2j on the ground that it is analogous to trade or business It is difficult to state these possible attributes definitely or exhaustively as a working principle it may be stated that an activity systematically or habitually undertaken for the production or distribution of goods or for the rendering of material services to the community at large or a part of such community with the help of employees -is an undertaking Such an activity generally involves the co- operation of the employer and the employees and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs It must be organised or arranged in a manner in which trade or business is generally organised or arranged It must not be casual nor must it be for oneself nor for pleasure Thus the manner in which the activity in question is organised or arranged the condition of the co-operation between employer and the employee necessary for its success and its object to render material service to the community can be regarded as some of the features which are distinctive of activities to which s 2j applies Judged by this test there would be no difficulty in holding that the State is carrying on an undertaking when it runs the group of Hospitals in question Is quid pro quo necessary for bringing an activity under s 2j  It has been urged before us that though profit motive may not be essential it is nevertheless necessary that the person who carries on the activity should receive some consideration in return  and it is only if the test of quid pro quo is satisfied that an activity should be treated as an undertaking Though this argument is put in a slightly different form in substance it is really based on the idea that profit motive is necessary to make any activity an undertaking analogous to trade or business If the absence of profit motive is immaterial why should an activity be excluded from s 2j merely because the person responsible for the conduct of the activity expects no consideration does not want any quid pro quo and is actuated by philanthropic or charitable motive  In our opinion in deciding the question as to whether any activity in question is an undertaking under s 2j the doctrine of quid pro quo can have no application Therefore we are satisfied that the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the conduct and running of the group of Hospitals by the appellant amounted to an undertaking under s 2 j and the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the fact that in the First Schedule to the Act which enumerates industries which may be declared as public utility service under s 2nvi three entries have been added by Act 36 of 1956 They are Defence Establishment services in hospitals and dispensaries and Fire Brigade service In other words by the addition of these three entries the Leo- islature has clearly indicated its intention that service in hospitals and dispensaries can be declared to be a public utility service under s 2nvi and there is no doubt that unless the service in hospitals falls under s 2j and is treated as an industry it cannot be declared to be a public utility service It is true that this particular entry had not been included in the First Schedule at the time when the present reference wag made but its subsequent inclusion can be reasonably taken as evidence of legislative intention and if on a construction of s 2j we have independently reached the conclusion that service in hospitals is service or the conduct of hospitals is an undertaking we may reasonably seek to derive corroboration to our conclusion by this subsequent legislative enactment After the addition of the relevant entry in the First Schedule it would not be open to anybody to suggest that service in hospitals does not fall under s 2j It now remains to consider some of the decisions to which our attention was invited In D N Banerji v P R Mukherjee  Ors 1 this Court was dealing with a a industrial dispute raised by the Municipal Workers' Union of the Budge Budge Municipality on behalf of the Sanitary Inspector and Head Clerk of the said Municipality on the ground that the dismissal of the said two Municipal employees was unjustified and 11953 SCR 302\n",

      "illegal and that they were entitled to an order of reinstatement The dispute thus referred to the Industrial Tribunal was decided in favour of the Union and an award was made directing the Municipality to reinstate the said two employees The Municipality then took the matter to the High Court at Calcutta by means of a petition for a writ of certiorari under Arts 226 and 227 of the Constitution It was urged in support of the petition that the Act was inapplicable to the dispute in question and that there was really no industrial dispute which could be validly referred to the Industrial Tribunal Other contentions were also raised but it is unnecessary to refer to them The High Court rejected all the pleas raised by the Municipality and dismissed the application for a writ The Municipality then brought the dispute to this Court under Art 1321 of the Constitution This Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the Municipality and confirmed the order of the High Court In dealing with the appeal this Court laid down certain propositions which are relevant for our purpose in the present appeal It was observed that \" in determining the meaning of the word \" industry \" and \" industrial dispute \" it was necessary to leave aside the original meaning attributed to the words in a simpler state of society then the contention of the Municipality that its activities in question did not amount to an industry were dealt with in these words \" The only ground on which one could say that what would amount to the carrying on of an industry if it is done by a private person ceases to be so if the same work is carried on by a local body like the Municipality is that in the latter there is nothing like the investment of any capital or the existence of a profit earning notice as there generally is in a business But neither the one nor the other seems a sine qua non or necessary element in the modern conception of industry \" It is because of this positive decision that the appellant has fairly conceded in the course of the argument before us that the absence of the profit motive or of investment of capital would not make a material difference in determinig the character of an activity this court has also examined the other relevant factors pertaining to the construction of the word \" industry \" and industry dispute\" and has declared its decision thus Having regard to the definitions found In our Act the aim or objective that the Legislature had in view and the nature variety and range of disputes that occur between employers and employees were forced to the conclusion that the definitions in our Act include also disputes that right arise between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be said to be analogy to the carrying out of a trade or business \" In the present appeal we have to decide the question as to \"hat attributes or features can be said to make an activity in question analogous to trade or business Incidentally we may add that quite apart from the relevant considerations which we have already discussed it would be difficult to suggest that though the sanitary department of a local body is an undertaking under s 2j a hospital run by a Government is not\n",

Court\\n       was delivered by\\nGAJENDRAGADKAR JThis is an appeal by the State of Bombay hereinafter called the appellant and two others and it arises from a writ petition filed against it by the Hospital Mazdoor Sabha a trade union registered under the Industrial Trade Unions Act XIV of 1926 and two of its members Mrs Vatsala Narayan and Mrs Ruth Isaac hereinafter called respondents I to 3 Respondents IQ and 3 were employed as Ward servants in the J J group of Hospitals The superintendent of this said group of Hospitals informed the said respondents by notices issued respectively against them that their services would be terminated with effect from the dates mentioned in the said notices and in accordance with the said notices their services were in fact terminated\\n\\nsubsequently in their place two State servants who were discharged from the Civil Supplies Department were appointed The writ petition filed by the respondents alleged that the retrenchment of respondents 2 and 3 was void as it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of ss 25F and 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 14 of 1947 hereinafter called the Act and it claimed a writ of mandamus directing the appellant to reinstate them in their posts This petition was resisted by the appellant on several grounds It was urged that the orders terminating the services of respondents 2 and 3 were not void and so the respondents claim for a writ was unjustified on the merits and it was argued that the writ application was wholly misconceived inasmuch as the J J group of Hospitals did not constitute an industry and so the relevant provisions of the Act were inapplicable to the respondents case This writ petition was heard by Tendolkar J The learned judge did not think it necessary to consider what he called the somewhat ticklish question as to whether the group of Hospitals constitutes an industry because he held that even assuming that the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable and could be invoked by the respondents it was not shown that the impugned orders were void In his opinion noncompliance with the provisions of s 251 did not invalidate the said orders and it was open to the respondents to seek for an appropriate remedy under s 251 of the Act He also held that the question about the application of s 25H did not arise On these findings the writ petition filed by the respondents was dismissed The matter was then taken before the Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal held that the impugned orders had not complied with the mandatory provisions of s 25F and so they were invalid and inoperative That is why the question as to whether s 25H applied was not considered by it The finding that the impugned orders were invalid for contravention of the mandatory provisions of s 25F made it necessary to decide the larger issue as to whether the Act applied to the Hospitals The Court of Appeal has observed that it was first inclined to send the matter back to Tendolkar J but it was requested by the learned counsel appearing for both the parties that it Would be better if the said question was decided by it as it was a question of law and the decision of the said issue by the Court of Appeal would avoid a remand and a further appeal That is how the issue was considered by the Court of Appeal and answered in favour of the respondents In the result the decision of Tendolkar J was reversed the writ petition was allowed and a writ in the nature of mandamus was issued against the appellant\\n\\nThe appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate of fitness from the Bombay High Court and with the said certificate it has brought the present appeal before us On behalf of the appellant two points have been raised for our decision in the present appeal Was the Appellate Court justifiedin holding that the contravention of the material provisions of s 25F of the Act rendered the impugned orders invalid and do the relevant provisions of the Act apply to the group of Hospitals run by the appellant are they an industry within the meaning of the Act \\n\\nBefore dealing with these points it would be relevant to state the material facts in regard to the group of Hospitals themselves which are not in dispute This group consists of five Hospitals It appears that in 1835 Sir Robert Grant the then Governor of Bombay desired to start an institution for the purposes of imparting medical education in the Presidency of Bombay His proposal in that behalf was sanctioned by the Board of Directors of the East India Company and funds amounting to Rs 44000 were collected for the purpose and an equal amount was contributed by the Directors to defray the cost of construction of the College building In 1843 the foundation of the Medical College building was laid and the same was completed in 1845 About that time an idea of building a hospital for the sick people of all classes and castes was mooted and Sir Jamsetjee Jeejibboy offered donation and some contribution was made by the Government with which the J J Hospital was constructed and it was formally opened on May 15 1845 Similarly the other four Hospitals in the group were built in course of time from donations Except for a small amount of Rs 10000 the rest of the expenditure which is in the neighbourhood of Rs 27 lakhs is entirely met by the appellant out of the grant sanctioned in the budget under the bead  38Medical  The group is under the administrative control of the Surgeon General of the appellant and its daytoday affairs are conducted and controlled by the Superintendent who is a full time employee of the appellant the residential staff including the Resident Medical Officers Assistant Medical Officers Housemen Nurses and others are all fulltime employees of the appellant and their salaries are drawn on the establishment pay bills every month and paid entirely by the appellant This group serves as a clinical training ground for students of the Grant Medical College which is a Government Medical College run and  managed by the appellant for imparting medical sciences leading to the Degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of the Bombay University as well as various PostGraduate qualifications of the said University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons Bombay the group is thus run and managed by the appellant to provide medical relief and to promote the health of the people of Bombay\\n\\nNow turning to the first point it may be stated that the facts on which the respondents plea is based are not in dispute It is conceded that the services of respondents 2 and 3 have been retrenched though it may be for the purpose of making room for other Government servants with a longer record of service who had to be retrenched owing to the closure of the appellant Civil Supplies Department It is also not disputed that the said respondents had not been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation as prescribed by s 25Fb The respondents contention is that the failure to comply with the said requirement makes the order of retrenchment invalid This plea has been upheld by the Court of Appeal Section 25F b provides that no workman employed III in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall beretrenched by that employer until he has been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months Clauses a and c of the said section prescribe similar conditions but we are not concerned with them On a plain reading of s 25F b it is clear that the requirement prescribed by it is a condition precedent for the retrenchment of the workman The section provides that no workman shall be retrenched until the condition in question has been satisfied It is difficult to accede to the argument that where the section imposes in mandatory terms a condition precedent noncompliance with the said condition would not render the impugned retrenchment invalid The argument which appealed to Tendolkar J however was that the consequence of noncompliance with the requirement of s 25F b was not to render the impugned retrenchment invalid because be thought that by s 251 a specific provision has been made for the recovery of the amount prescribed by s 25F b Section 251 provides for the recovery of monies due from employers under Ch V and according to Tendolkor J this provision covers the amount due to the workman by way of compensation under s 25F b In our opinion this view is untenable Having regard to the fact that the words used in s 25F b are mandatory and their effect is plain and unambiguous it seems to us that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that s 251 covered cases of recover of ninnies other than those specified in s 25F b an it is obvious that there are several other cases i which monies become due from the employers to th employees under Ch V it is for the recovery of the monies that s 251 had been enacted Therefore we see no substance in the argument that the Court of Appeal has misconstrued s 25F\\n\\nb That being so failure to comply with the said provision renders the impugned orders invalid and inoperative Does the said provision apply to the present proceedings  In other words is the Act itself applicable to the group of Hospitals with which are concerned  That is the next question which calls for an answer in the present appeal Indeed it is this general question which has been strenuously argued before us by the learned Solicitor General on behalf of the appellant The decision of this question depends upon the interpretation of the definition of industry  prescribed by s 2j of the Act Let us first read the definition Section 2j providies that industry means any business trade undertaking manufacture of calling of employers and includes any calling service employment handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen It would be noticed that the words used in the definition are very wide in their import and even so its latter part purports to provide an inclusive definition The word undertaking according to Webster means anything undertaken  any business work or project which one engages in or attempts an enterprise  Similarly  trade  according to Halsbury in its primary meaning is  exchange of goods for goods or goods for money  and in its secondary meaning it is  any business carried on with a view to profit whether manual or mercantile as distinguished from the liberal arts or learned professions and from agriculture  whereas  business  is a wider term not synonymous with trade and means practically  anything which is an occupation as distinguished from a pleasure The word SC calling  again is very wide it meansones usual occupation vocation business or trade so is the word service very wide in its import Prima facie if the definition has deliberately used words of such wide import it would be necessary to read those words in their wide denotation and so read Hospitals cannot be excluded from the definition\\n\\nIt is however contended that in construing the definition we must adopt the rule of construction noscuntur a sociis This rule according to Maxwell means that when two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled toge\\n\\nther they are understood to be used in their cognate sense They take is it were their colour from each other that is the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to a less general The same rule is thus interpreted in  Words and Phrases  Vol XIV P 207  Associated words take their meaning from one another under the doctrine of noscuntur a sociis the philosophy of which is that the meaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it such doctrine is broader than the maxim Ejusdem Generis In fact the latter I maxim is only an illustration or specific application of the broader maxim noscuntur a sociis  The argument is that certain essential features or attributes are invariably associated with the words  business and trade  as understood in the popular and conventional sense and it is the colour of these attributes which is taken by the other words used in the definition though their normal import may be much wider We are not impressed by this argument It must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider 1 is only where the intention of the Legislature i associating wider words with words of narrow significance is doubtful or otherwise not clear that the present rule of construction can be useful applied It can also be applied where the meaning of the words of wider import is doubtful but where the object of the Legislature in using wider words i clear and free of ambiguity the rule of construction in question cannot be pressed into service As ha been observed by Earl of Halsbury L C in The Corporation of Glasgow v Glasgow Tramway an Omnibus Co Ltd 1 in dealing with the wider word used in s 6 of Valuation of Lands Scotland Act 1854  the words free from all expenses whatever i connection with the said tramways appear to me to be so wide in their application that I should have thought it impossible to qualify or cut them down by their being associated with other words on the 1 1898 AC 63 at p 634\\n\\nprinciple of their being ejusdem generis with the previous words enumerated  If the object and scope of the statute are considered there would be no difficulty in holding that the relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the Legislature in defining  industry in s 2j The object of the Act was to make provision for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes and the extent and scope of its provisions would be realised if we bear in mind the definition of  industrial dispute  given by s 2k of  wagesby s 2rr  workman  by s 2s and of  employer by s 2g Besides the definition of public utility service prescribed by s 2m is very significant One has merely to glance at the six categories of public utility service mentioned by s 2m to realise that the rule of construction on which the appellant relies is inapplicable in interpreting the definition prescribed by s 2j\\n\\nThere is another point which cannot be ignored Section 2j does not define  industry  in the usual manner by prescribing what it means the first clause of the definition gives the statutory meaning of  industry  and the second clause deliberately refers to several other items of industry and brings them in the definition in an inclusive way It is obvious that the words used in an inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated as restricted in any sense Vide Strouds  Judicial Dictionary  Vol 2 p 1415 Where we are dealing with an inclusive definition it would be inappropriate to put a restrictive interpretation upon terms of wider denotation Besides it would be relevant to point out that too much reliance cannot be placed on what are described as the essential attributes or features of trade or business as conventionally understood The conventional meaning attributed to the words trade and business has lost some of it validity for the purpose of industrial adjudication Industrial adjudication has necessarily to be aware of the current of socioeconomic thought around it must recogiiise that in the modern welfare State healthy industrial relations are a matter of paramount import\\n\\nance and its essential function is to assist the State by helping a solution of industrial disputes which constitute a distinct and persistent phenomenon of modern industrialised States In attempting to solve industrial disputes industrial adjudication does not and should not adopt a doctrinnaire approach It must evolve some working principles and should generally avoid formulating or adopting abstract generalisations Nevertheless it cannot harp back to oldage notions about the relations between employer and employee or to the doctrine of laissez faire which then governed the regulation of the said relations That is why we think in construing the wide words used in s 2j it would be erroneous to attach undue importance to attributes associated with business or trade in the popular mind in days gone by\\n\\nIt is clear however that though s 2j uses words of very wide denotation a line would have to be drawn in a fair and just manner so as to exclude some callings services or undertakings If all the words used are given their widest meaning all services and all callings would come within the purview of the definition even service rendered by a servant purely in a personal or domestic matter or even in a casual way would fall within the definition It is not and cannot be suggested that in its wide sweep the word service is intended to include service howsoever rendered in whatsoever capacity and for whatsoever reason We must therefore consider where the line should be drawn and what limitations can and should be reasonably implied in interpreting the wide words used in s 2j and that no doubt is a somewhat difficult problem to decide It is true that under the oldworld notion prevailing under the capitalist form of society industry generally means an economic activity involving investment of capital systematically carried on for profit for the production or sale of goods by the employment of labour When it is urged by the appellant that an undertaking should be analogous to trade or business what is really intended is that unless the undertaking in question shares the aforesaid essential features associated with the conventional notion of trade or business it should not be treated as falling under s 2j There are two serious difficulties in accepting such a suggestion and indeed the appellant concedes the presence of these two difficulties It is not disputed that under s 2j an activity can and must be regarded as an industry even though in carrying it out profit motive may be absent It is also common ground that the absence of investment of any capital would not make a material difference to the applicability of s 2j Thus two of the important attributes conventionally associated with trade or business are not necessarily predicated in interpreting s 2j What then can be said to be the attributes or features which should be common between trade and business on the one hand and an undertaking and other items mentioned in s 2j on the other \\n\\nIt would be possible to exclude some activities from s 2j without any difficulty Negatively stated the activities of the Government which can be properly described as regal or sovereign activities are outsidly the scope of s 2j These are functions which a constitutional Government can and must undertake for governance and which no private citizen can undertake This position is not in dispute An attempt is however made by the appellant to suggest that in view of the Directive Principles enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution and in view of the ideal of a welfare State which has been placed before the country Governments both at the level of the States as well as at the Centre undertake several welfare activities and the argument is that the field of governmental or regal activities which are excluded from the operation of s 2j should be extended to cover other activities undertaken by the Governments in pursuit of their welfare policies In our opinion this contention cannot be accepted  The activities which do not fall within s 2j and which are described as governmental or regal or sovereign have been pithily described by Lord Watson as the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional Government Vide Coomber v Justices of Berks1  and it is only these activities that are outside the scope of s 2j It sounds incongruous and self contradictory 1 1883 App cas 61\\n\\nto suggest that activities undertaken by the Government in the interests of socioeconomic progress of the country as beneficial measures should be exempted from the operation of the Act which in substance is a very important beneficial measure itself In this connection it would be relevant to point out that the definition of the word employer given by s 2g is not without significance an employer means under s 2gi in relation to an industry carried on by or under the authority of any department of the Central Government or State Government authority prescribed in this behalf or where no authority is prescribed the head of the department This definition clearly indicates that the Legislature intended the application of the Act to activities of the Government which fall within s 2j In considering the question as to whether the group of Hospitals run by the appellant undoubtedly for the purpose of giving medical relief to the citizens and for helping to impart medical education are an undertaking or not it would be pertinent to enquire whether an activity of a like nature would be an undertaking if it is carried on by a private citizen or a group of private citizens There is no doubt that if a hospital is run by private citizens for profit it would be an undertaking very much like the trade or business in their conventional sense We have already stated that the presence of profit motive is not essential for bringing an undertaking within s 2 j If that be so if a private citizen runs a hospital without charging any fees from the patients treated in it would nevertheless be an undertaking under s 2j Thus the character of the activity involved in running a hospital brings the institution of the hospital within s 2j Does it make any difference that the hospital is run by the Government in the interpretation of the word undertaking in s 2j  In our opinion the answer to this question must be in the negative It is the character of the activity which decides the question as to whether the activity in question attracts the provision of s 2j who conducts the activity and whether it is conducted for profit or not do not make a material difference\\n\\nWe have yet to decide which are the attributes the presence of which makes in activity an under taking within s 2j on the ground that it is analogous to trade or business It is difficult to state these possible attributes definitely or exhaustively as a working principle it may be stated that an activity systematically or habitually undertaken for the production or distribution of goods or for the rendering of material services to the community at large or a part of such community with the help of employees is an undertaking Such an activity generally involves the co operation of the employer and the employees and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs It must be organised or arranged in a manner in which trade or business is generally organised or arranged It must not be casual nor must it be for oneself nor for pleasure Thus the manner in which the activity in question is organised or arranged the condition of the cooperation between employer and the employee necessary for its success and its object to render material service to the community can be regarded as some of the features which are distinctive of activities to which s 2j applies Judged by this test there would be no difficulty in holding that the State is carrying on an undertaking when it runs the group of Hospitals in question Is quid pro quo necessary for bringing an activity under s 2j  It has been urged before us that though profit motive may not be essential it is nevertheless necessary that the person who carries on the activity should receive some consideration in return  and it is only if the test of quid pro quo is satisfied that an activity should be treated as an undertaking Though this argument is put in a slightly different form in substance it is really based on the idea that profit motive is necessary to make any activity an undertaking analogous to trade or business If the absence of profit motive is immaterial why should an activity be excluded from s 2j merely because the person responsible for the conduct of the activity expects no consideration does not want any quid pro quo and is actuated by philanthropic or charitable motive  In our opinion in deciding the question as to whether any activity in question is an undertaking under s 2j the doctrine of quid pro quo can have no application Therefore we are satisfied that the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the conduct and running of the group of Hospitals by the appellant amounted to an undertaking under s 2 j and the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the fact that in the First Schedule to the Act which enumerates industries which may be declared as public utility service under s 2nvi three entries have been added by Act 36 of 1956 They are Defence Establishment services in hospitals and dispensaries and Fire Brigade service In other words by the addition of these three entries the Leo islature has clearly indicated its intention that service in hospitals and dispensaries can be declared to be a public utility service under s 2nvi and there is no doubt that unless the service in hospitals falls under s 2j and is treated as an industry it cannot be declared to be a public utility service It is true that this particular entry had not been included in the First Schedule at the time when the present reference wag made but its subsequent inclusion can be reasonably taken as evidence of legislative intention and if on a construction of s 2j we have independently reached the conclusion that service in hospitals is service or the conduct of hospitals is an undertaking we may reasonably seek to derive corroboration to our conclusion by this subsequent legislative enactment After the addition of the relevant entry in the First Schedule it would not be open to anybody to suggest that service in hospitals does not fall under s 2j It now remains to consider some of the decisions to which our attention was invited In D N Banerji v P R Mukherjee  Ors 1 this Court was dealing with a a industrial dispute raised by the Municipal Workers Union of the Budge Budge Municipality on behalf of the Sanitary Inspector and Head Clerk of the said Municipality on the ground that the dismissal of the said two Municipal employees was unjustified and 11953 SCR 302\\n\\nillegal and that they were entitled to an order of reinstatement The dispute thus referred to the Industrial Tribunal was decided in favour of the Union and an award was made directing the Municipality to reinstate the said two employees The Municipality then took the matter to the High Court at Calcutta by means of a petition for a writ of certiorari under Arts 226 and 227 of the Constitution It was urged in support of the petition that the Act was inapplicable to the dispute in question and that there was really no industrial dispute which could be validly referred to the Industrial Tribunal Other contentions were also raised but it is unnecessary to refer to them The High Court rejected all the pleas raised by the Municipality and dismissed the application for a writ The Municipality then brought the dispute to this Court under Art 1321 of the Constitution This Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the Municipality and confirmed the order of the High Court In dealing with the appeal this Court laid down certain propositions which are relevant for our purpose in the present appeal It was observed that  in determining the meaning of the word  industry  and  industrial dispute  it was necessary to leave aside the original meaning attributed to the words in a simpler state of society then the contention of the Municipality that its activities in question did not amount to an industry were dealt with in these words  The only ground on which one could say that what would amount to the carrying on of an industry if it is done by a private person ceases to be so if the same work is carried on by a local body like the Municipality is that in the latter there is nothing like the investment of any capital or the existence of a profit earning notice as there generally is in a business But neither the one nor the other seems a sine qua non or necessary element in the modern conception of industry  It is because of this positive decision that the appellant has fairly conceded in the course of the argument before us that the absence of the profit motive or of investment of capital would not make a material difference in determinig the character of an activity this court has also examined the other relevant factors pertaining to the construction of the word  industry  and industry dispute and has declared its decision thus Having regard to the definitions found In our Act the aim or objective that the Legislature had in view and the nature variety and range of disputes that occur between employers and employees were forced to the conclusion that the definitions in our Act include also disputes that right arise between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be said to be analogy to the carrying out of a trade or business  In the present appeal we have to decide the question as to hat attributes or features can be said to make an activity in question analogous to trade or business Incidentally we may add that quite apart from the relevant considerations which we have already discussed it would be difficult to suggest that though the sanitary department of a local body is an undertaking under s 2j a hospital run by a Government is not\\n\\nThis decision has been referred to by this Court in Baroda Borough Municipality v Its Workmen 1 and it has been observed that it is now finally settled that a municipal undertaking of the nature with which the court was then concerned is an industry within the meaning of the definition of that word in s 2j of the Act and that the expression industrial dispute  in that Act includes disputes between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be regarded as analogous to the carrying on of a trade or business In that case this Court was concerned with the claim for bonus made by the workmen of the Baroda Borough Municipality and it was rejected comment has been made by learned counsel on some of the grounds accepted by this Court in support of its final decision but in the present appeal we are not concerned with the claim for bonus and it is not necessary for us to refer to the said comment or to deal with it\\n\\nSo far as the decisions of the Industrial Tribunals are concerned it appears that the Labour Appellate Tribunal has held as early as 1952 that a hospital is an undertaking within the meaning of s 2j In 11957 SCR 33\\n\\nSri Vishuddhananda Saraswathi Marwari Hospital v Their Workmen 1 the Labour Appellate Tribunal considered at length the policy and object of the Act several judgments cited before it and came to the conclusion that the definition of industry in s 2j was of wide amplitude and that there was no good reason for cutting down its natural meaning so as to limit its operation to profitmaking enterprises only It has not been suggested before us that this view has ever been doubted or dissented from in any subsequent industrial adjudication\\n\\nIn judicial discussions about the scope and character of the concept of industry as it has developed in a modern democratic State the decision of the High Court of Australia in The Federated State School Teachers Association of Australia And The State of Victoria Ors 2 is generally cited In that case according to the majority decision it was held that the educational activities of the State carried on under the appropriate statutes and statutory regulations of each State relating to education did not constitute an industry with the meaning of s 4 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 19041928  that the occupation of teachers so employed was riot an industrial occupation and that the dispute which existed between the State and the teachers employed by them was therefore not an industrial dispute within s 51 xxxv of the Constitution Isaacs J however struck an emphatic note of dissent and the principles enunciated in this note of dissent have received approval from industrial tribunals in this country and they have been rightly accepted by the Bombay High Court as affording valuable assistance in deciding the question in the present proceedings Isaacs J has uttered a note of caution that in dealing with industrial disputes industrial adjudicators must be conversant with the current knowledge on the subject and they should not ignore the constant currents of life around them for otherwise it would introduce a serious infirmity in their approach Dealing with the general characteristics of industrial enterprises the learned judge observed 1 1952 II LLJ 327\\n\\n2 1929 4 CLR 569\\n\\nthat they contribute more or less to the general welfare of the community and he has reiterated his earlier observations on the point in these words Industrial disputes occur when in relation to operations in which capital and labour are contributed in cooperation for the satisfaction of human wants or desires those engaged in cooperation dispute as to basis to be observed by the parties engaged respecting either a share of the product or any other terms or conditions of their cooperation  According to the learned judge the question must always be decided by determing the true character of the activity in question It is these tests which the High Court has applied in deciding the present dispute and we are in general agreement with the decision of the High Court We ought to make it clear that in the present appeal we are not expressing any opinion on the question as to whether running an educational institution would be an industry under the Act that question does not arise in the present proceedings\\n\\nThere are two more decisions to which reference may be made before we part with this appeal In Brij Mohan Bagaria And Chatterjee NC  Ors 1 the Calcutta High Court was dealing with a dispute between an attorney of the court and some of his employees who bad been dismissed by him and it was held that the said dispute was outside the purview of the Act Sinha J who heard the petition filed by the attorney observed that  however extended the meaning be given to the word industry or to industrial dispute or to undertaking or calling we cannot include within their concept the case of an individual who carries on a profession dependent upon its own intellectual skill  The learned judge has then added that  every case must be decided upon its own facts  It appears that according to the learned judge if an attorney or a doctor or a lawyer who follows a liberal profession the pursuit of which depends upon his own education intellectual attainments and special equipment engages employees that would not mean that the employer is engaging in an industry under s 2j but with the question of the attorney or doctor 1 1958 11 LLJ 190\\n\\nor the lawyer we are not directly concerned in the present appeal We have however referred to this decision because in the course of discussion the learned judge has expressed his dissent from the view taken by the Bombay High Court in regard to hospitals and we wish to make it clear that in our opinion the criticism made by the learned judge against the inclusion of hospitals within s 2j is not wellfounded Dealing with a similar case of an attorney the Bombay High Court has taken the same view in National Union of Commercial Employees  Anr And Meher MR  Ors Pereira Fazalbhoy  Co 1 We would accordingly bold that the High Court was right in holding that the dispute between the appellant and the respondents was an industrial dispute to which s 251 of the Act applied The order passed by the High Court on the writ petition filed by the respondents is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs\\n\\nAppeal dismissed\\n'"

      "Victoria & Ors., ( The appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate of fitness from the Bombay High Court and with the said certificate it has brought the present appeal before us. It appears that in 1835 Sir Robert Grant, the then Governor of Bombay, desired to start an institution for the purposes of imparting medical education in the Presidency of Bombay. 44,000 were collected for the purpose and an equal amount was contributed by the Directors to defray the cost of construction of the College building. ' About that time an idea of building a hospital for the sick people of all classes and castes was mooted and Sir Jamsetjee Jeejibboy offered donation and some contribution was made by the Government with which the J. J. Hospital was constructed and it was formally opened on May 15, 1845. Having regard to the fact that the words used in s. 25F (b) are mandatory and their effect is plain and unambiguous it seems to us that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that s. 251 covered cases of recover of ninnies other than those specified in s. 25F (b), an it is obvious that there are several other cases i which monies become due from the employers to th employees under Ch. The word \"undertaking\" according to Webster means\" anything undertaken ; any business, work or project which one engages in or attempts, an enterprise \". It must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider. It can also be applied where the meaning of the words of wider import is doubtful; but, where the object of the Legislature in using wider words i clear and free of ambiguity, the rule of construction in question cannot be pressed into service. Industrial adjudication has necessarily to be aware of the current of socioeconomic thought around; it must recogiiise that in the modern welfare State healthy industrial relations are a matter of paramount import-\n",

      "ance and its essential function is to assist the State by helping a solution of industrial disputes which constitute a distinct and persistent phenomenon of modern ~industrialised States. Thus, two of the important attributes conventionally associated with trade or business are not necessarily predicated in interpreting s. 2(j). These are functions which a constitutional Government can and must undertake for governance and which no private citizen can undertake. An attempt is, however, made by the appellant to suggest that in view of the Directive Principles enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution and in view of the ideal of a welfare State which has been placed before the country, Governments, both at the level of the States as well as at the Centre, undertake several welfare activities; and the argument is that the field of governmental or regal activities which are excluded from the operation of s. 2(j) should be extended to cover other activities undertaken by the Governments in pursuit of their welfare policies. There is no doubt that if a hospital is run by private citizens for profit it would be an undertaking very much like the trade or business in their conventional sense. Does it make any difference that the hospital is run by the Government in the interpretation of the word \"undertaking\" in s. 2(j) ? Such an activity generally involves the co- operation of the employer and the employees; and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs. In our opinion, in deciding the question as to whether any activity in question is an undertaking under s. 2(j) the doctrine of quid pro quo can have no application. In other words, by the addition of these three entries the Leo- islature has clearly indicated its intention that service in hospitals and dispensaries can be declared to be a public utility service under s. 2(n)(vi); and there is no doubt that unless the service in hospitals falls under s. 2(j) and is treated as an industry it cannot be declared to be a public utility service. It is these tests which the High Court has applied in deciding the present dispute and we are in general agreement with the decision of the High Court. We ought to make it clear that in the present appeal we are not expressing any opinion on the question as to whether running an educational institution would be an industry under the Act; that question does not arise in the present proceedings. We would accordingly bold that the High Court was right in holding that the dispute between the appellant and the respondents was an industrial dispute to which s. 251' of the Act applied.\n"

      "ance and its essential function is to assist the State by helping a solution of industrial disputes which constitute a distinct and persistent phenomenon of modern ~industrialised States Thus two of the important attributes conventionally associated with trade or business are not necessarily predicated in interpreting s 2j These are functions which a constitutional Government can and must undertake for governance and which no private citizen can undertake An attempt is however made by the appellant to suggest that in view of the Directive Principles enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution and in view of the ideal of a welfare State which has been placed before the country Governments both at the level of the States as well as at the Centre undertake several welfare activities and the argument is that the field of governmental or regal activities which are excluded from the operation of s 2j should be extended to cover other activities undertaken by the Governments in pursuit of their welfare policies There is no doubt that if a hospital is run by private citizens for profit it would be an undertaking very much like the trade or business in their conventional sense Does it make any difference that the hospital is run by the Government in the interpretation of the word \"undertaking\" in s 2j  Such an activity generally involves the co- operation of the employer and the employees and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs In our opinion in deciding the question as to whether any activity in question is an undertaking under s 2j the doctrine of quid pro quo can have no application In other words by the addition of these three entries the Leo- islature has clearly indicated its intention that service in hospitals and dispensaries can be declared to be a public utility service under s 2nvi and there is no doubt that unless the service in hospitals falls under s 2j and is treated as an industry it cannot be declared to be a public utility service It is these tests which the High Court has applied in deciding the present dispute and we are in general agreement with the decision of the High Court We ought to make it clear that in the present appeal we are not expressing any opinion on the question as to whether running an educational institution would be an industry under the Act that question does not arise in the present proceedings We would accordingly bold that the High Court was right in holding that the dispute between the appellant and the respondents was an industrial dispute to which s 251' of the Act applied\n"

Court\\n       was delivered by\\nGAJENDRAGADKAR JThis is an appeal by the State of Bombay hereinafter called the appellant and two others and it arises from a writ petition filed against it by the Hospital Mazdoor Sabha a trade union registered under the Industrial Trade Unions Act XIV of 1926 and two of its members Mrs Vatsala Narayan and Mrs Ruth Isaac hereinafter called respondents I to 3 Respondents IQ and 3 were employed as Ward servants in the J J group of Hospitals The superintendent of this said group of Hospitals informed the said respondents by notices issued respectively against them that their services would be terminated with effect from the dates mentioned in the said notices and in accordance with the said notices their services were in fact terminated\\n\\nsubsequently in their place two State servants who were discharged from the Civil Supplies Department were appointed The writ petition filed by the respondents alleged that the retrenchment of respondents 2 and 3 was void as it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of ss 25F and 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 14 of 1947 hereinafter called the Act and it claimed a writ of mandamus directing the appellant to reinstate them in their posts This petition was resisted by the appellant on several grounds It was urged that the orders terminating the services of respondents 2 and 3 were not void and so the respondents claim for a writ was unjustified on the merits and it was argued that the writ application was wholly misconceived inasmuch as the J J group of Hospitals did not constitute an industry and so the relevant provisions of the Act were inapplicable to the respondents case This writ petition was heard by Tendolkar J The learned judge did not think it necessary to consider what he called the somewhat ticklish question as to whether the group of Hospitals constitutes an industry because he held that even assuming that the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable and could be invoked by the respondents it was not shown that the impugned orders were void In his opinion noncompliance with the provisions of s 251 did not invalidate the said orders and it was open to the respondents to seek for an appropriate remedy under s 251 of the Act He also held that the question about the application of s 25H did not arise On these findings the writ petition filed by the respondents was dismissed The matter was then taken before the Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal held that the impugned orders had not complied with the mandatory provisions of s 25F and so they were invalid and inoperative That is why the question as to whether s 25H applied was not considered by it The finding that the impugned orders were invalid for contravention of the mandatory provisions of s 25F made it necessary to decide the larger issue as to whether the Act applied to the Hospitals The Court of Appeal has observed that it was first inclined to send the matter back to Tendolkar J but it was requested by the learned counsel appearing for both the parties that it Would be better if the said question was decided by it as it was a question of law and the decision of the said issue by the Court of Appeal would avoid a remand and a further appeal That is how the issue was considered by the Court of Appeal and answered in favour of the respondents In the result the decision of Tendolkar J was reversed the writ petition was allowed and a writ in the nature of mandamus was issued against the appellant\\n\\nThe appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate of fitness from the Bombay High Court and with the said certificate it has brought the present appeal before us On behalf of the appellant two points have been raised for our decision in the present appeal Was the Appellate Court justifiedin holding that the contravention of the material provisions of s 25F of the Act rendered the impugned orders invalid and do the relevant provisions of the Act apply to the group of Hospitals run by the appellant are they an industry within the meaning of the Act \\n\\nBefore dealing with these points it would be relevant to state the material facts in regard to the group of Hospitals themselves which are not in dispute This group consists of five Hospitals It appears that in 1835 Sir Robert Grant the then Governor of Bombay desired to start an institution for the purposes of imparting medical education in the Presidency of Bombay His proposal in that behalf was sanctioned by the Board of Directors of the East India Company and funds amounting to Rs 44000 were collected for the purpose and an equal amount was contributed by the Directors to defray the cost of construction of the College building In 1843 the foundation of the Medical College building was laid and the same was completed in 1845 About that time an idea of building a hospital for the sick people of all classes and castes was mooted and Sir Jamsetjee Jeejibboy offered donation and some contribution was made by the Government with which the J J Hospital was constructed and it was formally opened on May 15 1845 Similarly the other four Hospitals in the group were built in course of time from donations Except for a small amount of Rs 10000 the rest of the expenditure which is in the neighbourhood of Rs 27 lakhs is entirely met by the appellant out of the grant sanctioned in the budget under the bead  38Medical  The group is under the administrative control of the Surgeon General of the appellant and its daytoday affairs are conducted and controlled by the Superintendent who is a full time employee of the appellant the residential staff including the Resident Medical Officers Assistant Medical Officers Housemen Nurses and others are all fulltime employees of the appellant and their salaries are drawn on the establishment pay bills every month and paid entirely by the appellant This group serves as a clinical training ground for students of the Grant Medical College which is a Government Medical College run and  managed by the appellant for imparting medical sciences leading to the Degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of the Bombay University as well as various PostGraduate qualifications of the said University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons Bombay the group is thus run and managed by the appellant to provide medical relief and to promote the health of the people of Bombay\\n\\nNow turning to the first point it may be stated that the facts on which the respondents plea is based are not in dispute It is conceded that the services of respondents 2 and 3 have been retrenched though it may be for the purpose of making room for other Government servants with a longer record of service who had to be retrenched owing to the closure of the appellant Civil Supplies Department It is also not disputed that the said respondents had not been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation as prescribed by s 25Fb The respondents contention is that the failure to comply with the said requirement makes the order of retrenchment invalid This plea has been upheld by the Court of Appeal Section 25F b provides that no workman employed III in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall beretrenched by that employer until he has been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months Clauses a and c of the said section prescribe similar conditions but we are not concerned with them On a plain reading of s 25F b it is clear that the requirement prescribed by it is a condition precedent for the retrenchment of the workman The section provides that no workman shall be retrenched until the condition in question has been satisfied It is difficult to accede to the argument that where the section imposes in mandatory terms a condition precedent noncompliance with the said condition would not render the impugned retrenchment invalid The argument which appealed to Tendolkar J however was that the consequence of noncompliance with the requirement of s 25F b was not to render the impugned retrenchment invalid because be thought that by s 251 a specific provision has been made for the recovery of the amount prescribed by s 25F b Section 251 provides for the recovery of monies due from employers under Ch V and according to Tendolkor J this provision covers the amount due to the workman by way of compensation under s 25F b In our opinion this view is untenable Having regard to the fact that the words used in s 25F b are mandatory and their effect is plain and unambiguous it seems to us that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that s 251 covered cases of recover of ninnies other than those specified in s 25F b an it is obvious that there are several other cases i which monies become due from the employers to th employees under Ch V it is for the recovery of the monies that s 251 had been enacted Therefore we see no substance in the argument that the Court of Appeal has misconstrued s 25F\\n\\nb That being so failure to comply with the said provision renders the impugned orders invalid and inoperative Does the said provision apply to the present proceedings  In other words is the Act itself applicable to the group of Hospitals with which are concerned  That is the next question which calls for an answer in the present appeal Indeed it is this general question which has been strenuously argued before us by the learned Solicitor General on behalf of the appellant The decision of this question depends upon the interpretation of the definition of industry  prescribed by s 2j of the Act Let us first read the definition Section 2j providies that industry means any business trade undertaking manufacture of calling of employers and includes any calling service employment handicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen It would be noticed that the words used in the definition are very wide in their import and even so its latter part purports to provide an inclusive definition The word undertaking according to Webster means anything undertaken  any business work or project which one engages in or attempts an enterprise  Similarly  trade  according to Halsbury in its primary meaning is  exchange of goods for goods or goods for money  and in its secondary meaning it is  any business carried on with a view to profit whether manual or mercantile as distinguished from the liberal arts or learned professions and from agriculture  whereas  business  is a wider term not synonymous with trade and means practically  anything which is an occupation as distinguished from a pleasure The word SC calling  again is very wide it meansones usual occupation vocation business or trade so is the word service very wide in its import Prima facie if the definition has deliberately used words of such wide import it would be necessary to read those words in their wide denotation and so read Hospitals cannot be excluded from the definition\\n\\nIt is however contended that in construing the definition we must adopt the rule of construction noscuntur a sociis This rule according to Maxwell means that when two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled toge\\n\\nther they are understood to be used in their cognate sense They take is it were their colour from each other that is the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to a less general The same rule is thus interpreted in  Words and Phrases  Vol XIV P 207  Associated words take their meaning from one another under the doctrine of noscuntur a sociis the philosophy of which is that the meaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it such doctrine is broader than the maxim Ejusdem Generis In fact the latter I maxim is only an illustration or specific application of the broader maxim noscuntur a sociis  The argument is that certain essential features or attributes are invariably associated with the words  business and trade  as understood in the popular and conventional sense and it is the colour of these attributes which is taken by the other words used in the definition though their normal import may be much wider We are not impressed by this argument It must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider 1 is only where the intention of the Legislature i associating wider words with words of narrow significance is doubtful or otherwise not clear that the present rule of construction can be useful applied It can also be applied where the meaning of the words of wider import is doubtful but where the object of the Legislature in using wider words i clear and free of ambiguity the rule of construction in question cannot be pressed into service As ha been observed by Earl of Halsbury L C in The Corporation of Glasgow v Glasgow Tramway an Omnibus Co Ltd 1 in dealing with the wider word used in s 6 of Valuation of Lands Scotland Act 1854  the words free from all expenses whatever i connection with the said tramways appear to me to be so wide in their application that I should have thought it impossible to qualify or cut them down by their being associated with other words on the 1 1898 AC 63 at p 634\\n\\nprinciple of their being ejusdem generis with the previous words enumerated  If the object and scope of the statute are considered there would be no difficulty in holding that the relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the Legislature in defining  industry in s 2j The object of the Act was to make provision for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes and the extent and scope of its provisions would be realised if we bear in mind the definition of  industrial dispute  given by s 2k of  wagesby s 2rr  workman  by s 2s and of  employer by s 2g Besides the definition of public utility service prescribed by s 2m is very significant One has merely to glance at the six categories of public utility service mentioned by s 2m to realise that the rule of construction on which the appellant relies is inapplicable in interpreting the definition prescribed by s 2j\\n\\nThere is another point which cannot be ignored Section 2j does not define  industry  in the usual manner by prescribing what it means the first clause of the definition gives the statutory meaning of  industry  and the second clause deliberately refers to several other items of industry and brings them in the definition in an inclusive way It is obvious that the words used in an inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated as restricted in any sense Vide Strouds  Judicial Dictionary  Vol 2 p 1415 Where we are dealing with an inclusive definition it would be inappropriate to put a restrictive interpretation upon terms of wider denotation Besides it would be relevant to point out that too much reliance cannot be placed on what are described as the essential attributes or features of trade or business as conventionally understood The conventional meaning attributed to the words trade and business has lost some of it validity for the purpose of industrial adjudication Industrial adjudication has necessarily to be aware of the current of socioeconomic thought around it must recogiiise that in the modern welfare State healthy industrial relations are a matter of paramount import\\n\\nance and its essential function is to assist the State by helping a solution of industrial disputes which constitute a distinct and persistent phenomenon of modern industrialised States In attempting to solve industrial disputes industrial adjudication does not and should not adopt a doctrinnaire approach It must evolve some working principles and should generally avoid formulating or adopting abstract generalisations Nevertheless it cannot harp back to oldage notions about the relations between employer and employee or to the doctrine of laissez faire which then governed the regulation of the said relations That is why we think in construing the wide words used in s 2j it would be erroneous to attach undue importance to attributes associated with business or trade in the popular mind in days gone by\\n\\nIt is clear however that though s 2j uses words of very wide denotation a line would have to be drawn in a fair and just manner so as to exclude some callings services or undertakings If all the words used are given their widest meaning all services and all callings would come within the purview of the definition even service rendered by a servant purely in a personal or domestic matter or even in a casual way would fall within the definition It is not and cannot be suggested that in its wide sweep the word service is intended to include service howsoever rendered in whatsoever capacity and for whatsoever reason We must therefore consider where the line should be drawn and what limitations can and should be reasonably implied in interpreting the wide words used in s 2j and that no doubt is a somewhat difficult problem to decide It is true that under the oldworld notion prevailing under the capitalist form of society industry generally means an economic activity involving investment of capital systematically carried on for profit for the production or sale of goods by the employment of labour When it is urged by the appellant that an undertaking should be analogous to trade or business what is really intended is that unless the undertaking in question shares the aforesaid essential features associated with the conventional notion of trade or business it should not be treated as falling under s 2j There are two serious difficulties in accepting such a suggestion and indeed the appellant concedes the presence of these two difficulties It is not disputed that under s 2j an activity can and must be regarded as an industry even though in carrying it out profit motive may be absent It is also common ground that the absence of investment of any capital would not make a material difference to the applicability of s 2j Thus two of the important attributes conventionally associated with trade or business are not necessarily predicated in interpreting s 2j What then can be said to be the attributes or features which should be common between trade and business on the one hand and an undertaking and other items mentioned in s 2j on the other \\n\\nIt would be possible to exclude some activities from s 2j without any difficulty Negatively stated the activities of the Government which can be properly described as regal or sovereign activities are outsidly the scope of s 2j These are functions which a constitutional Government can and must undertake for governance and which no private citizen can undertake This position is not in dispute An attempt is however made by the appellant to suggest that in view of the Directive Principles enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution and in view of the ideal of a welfare State which has been placed before the country Governments both at the level of the States as well as at the Centre undertake several welfare activities and the argument is that the field of governmental or regal activities which are excluded from the operation of s 2j should be extended to cover other activities undertaken by the Governments in pursuit of their welfare policies In our opinion this contention cannot be accepted  The activities which do not fall within s 2j and which are described as governmental or regal or sovereign have been pithily described by Lord Watson as the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional Government Vide Coomber v Justices of Berks1  and it is only these activities that are outside the scope of s 2j It sounds incongruous and self contradictory 1 1883 App cas 61\\n\\nto suggest that activities undertaken by the Government in the interests of socioeconomic progress of the country as beneficial measures should be exempted from the operation of the Act which in substance is a very important beneficial measure itself In this connection it would be relevant to point out that the definition of the word employer given by s 2g is not without significance an employer means under s 2gi in relation to an industry carried on by or under the authority of any department of the Central Government or State Government authority prescribed in this behalf or where no authority is prescribed the head of the department This definition clearly indicates that the Legislature intended the application of the Act to activities of the Government which fall within s 2j In considering the question as to whether the group of Hospitals run by the appellant undoubtedly for the purpose of giving medical relief to the citizens and for helping to impart medical education are an undertaking or not it would be pertinent to enquire whether an activity of a like nature would be an undertaking if it is carried on by a private citizen or a group of private citizens There is no doubt that if a hospital is run by private citizens for profit it would be an undertaking very much like the trade or business in their conventional sense We have already stated that the presence of profit motive is not essential for bringing an undertaking within s 2 j If that be so if a private citizen runs a hospital without charging any fees from the patients treated in it would nevertheless be an undertaking under s 2j Thus the character of the activity involved in running a hospital brings the institution of the hospital within s 2j Does it make any difference that the hospital is run by the Government in the interpretation of the word undertaking in s 2j  In our opinion the answer to this question must be in the negative It is the character of the activity which decides the question as to whether the activity in question attracts the provision of s 2j who conducts the activity and whether it is conducted for profit or not do not make a material difference\\n\\nWe have yet to decide which are the attributes the presence of which makes in activity an under taking within s 2j on the ground that it is analogous to trade or business It is difficult to state these possible attributes definitely or exhaustively as a working principle it may be stated that an activity systematically or habitually undertaken for the production or distribution of goods or for the rendering of material services to the community at large or a part of such community with the help of employees is an undertaking Such an activity generally involves the co operation of the employer and the employees and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs It must be organised or arranged in a manner in which trade or business is generally organised or arranged It must not be casual nor must it be for oneself nor for pleasure Thus the manner in which the activity in question is organised or arranged the condition of the cooperation between employer and the employee necessary for its success and its object to render material service to the community can be regarded as some of the features which are distinctive of activities to which s 2j applies Judged by this test there would be no difficulty in holding that the State is carrying on an undertaking when it runs the group of Hospitals in question Is quid pro quo necessary for bringing an activity under s 2j  It has been urged before us that though profit motive may not be essential it is nevertheless necessary that the person who carries on the activity should receive some consideration in return  and it is only if the test of quid pro quo is satisfied that an activity should be treated as an undertaking Though this argument is put in a slightly different form in substance it is really based on the idea that profit motive is necessary to make any activity an undertaking analogous to trade or business If the absence of profit motive is immaterial why should an activity be excluded from s 2j merely because the person responsible for the conduct of the activity expects no consideration does not want any quid pro quo and is actuated by philanthropic or charitable motive  In our opinion in deciding the question as to whether any activity in question is an undertaking under s 2j the doctrine of quid pro quo can have no application Therefore we are satisfied that the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the conduct and running of the group of Hospitals by the appellant amounted to an undertaking under s 2 j and the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the fact that in the First Schedule to the Act which enumerates industries which may be declared as public utility service under s 2nvi three entries have been added by Act 36 of 1956 They are Defence Establishment services in hospitals and dispensaries and Fire Brigade service In other words by the addition of these three entries the Leo islature has clearly indicated its intention that service in hospitals and dispensaries can be declared to be a public utility service under s 2nvi and there is no doubt that unless the service in hospitals falls under s 2j and is treated as an industry it cannot be declared to be a public utility service It is true that this particular entry had not been included in the First Schedule at the time when the present reference wag made but its subsequent inclusion can be reasonably taken as evidence of legislative intention and if on a construction of s 2j we have independently reached the conclusion that service in hospitals is service or the conduct of hospitals is an undertaking we may reasonably seek to derive corroboration to our conclusion by this subsequent legislative enactment After the addition of the relevant entry in the First Schedule it would not be open to anybody to suggest that service in hospitals does not fall under s 2j It now remains to consider some of the decisions to which our attention was invited In D N Banerji v P R Mukherjee  Ors 1 this Court was dealing with a a industrial dispute raised by the Municipal Workers Union of the Budge Budge Municipality on behalf of the Sanitary Inspector and Head Clerk of the said Municipality on the ground that the dismissal of the said two Municipal employees was unjustified and 11953 SCR 302\\n\\nillegal and that they were entitled to an order of reinstatement The dispute thus referred to the Industrial Tribunal was decided in favour of the Union and an award was made directing the Municipality to reinstate the said two employees The Municipality then took the matter to the High Court at Calcutta by means of a petition for a writ of certiorari under Arts 226 and 227 of the Constitution It was urged in support of the petition that the Act was inapplicable to the dispute in question and that there was really no industrial dispute which could be validly referred to the Industrial Tribunal Other contentions were also raised but it is unnecessary to refer to them The High Court rejected all the pleas raised by the Municipality and dismissed the application for a writ The Municipality then brought the dispute to this Court under Art 1321 of the Constitution This Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the Municipality and confirmed the order of the High Court In dealing with the appeal this Court laid down certain propositions which are relevant for our purpose in the present appeal It was observed that  in determining the meaning of the word  industry  and  industrial dispute  it was necessary to leave aside the original meaning attributed to the words in a simpler state of society then the contention of the Municipality that its activities in question did not amount to an industry were dealt with in these words  The only ground on which one could say that what would amount to the carrying on of an industry if it is done by a private person ceases to be so if the same work is carried on by a local body like the Municipality is that in the latter there is nothing like the investment of any capital or the existence of a profit earning notice as there generally is in a business But neither the one nor the other seems a sine qua non or necessary element in the modern conception of industry  It is because of this positive decision that the appellant has fairly conceded in the course of the argument before us that the absence of the profit motive or of investment of capital would not make a material difference in determinig the character of an activity this court has also examined the other relevant factors pertaining to the construction of the word  industry  and industry dispute and has declared its decision thus Having regard to the definitions found In our Act the aim or objective that the Legislature had in view and the nature variety and range of disputes that occur between employers and employees were forced to the conclusion that the definitions in our Act include also disputes that right arise between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be said to be analogy to the carrying out of a trade or business  In the present appeal we have to decide the question as to hat attributes or features can be said to make an activity in question analogous to trade or business Incidentally we may add that quite apart from the relevant considerations which we have already discussed it would be difficult to suggest that though the sanitary department of a local body is an undertaking under s 2j a hospital run by a Government is not\\n\\nThis decision has been referred to by this Court in Baroda Borough Municipality v Its Workmen 1 and it has been observed that it is now finally settled that a municipal undertaking of the nature with which the court was then concerned is an industry within the meaning of the definition of that word in s 2j of the Act and that the expression industrial dispute  in that Act includes disputes between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be regarded as analogous to the carrying on of a trade or business In that case this Court was concerned with the claim for bonus made by the workmen of the Baroda Borough Municipality and it was rejected comment has been made by learned counsel on some of the grounds accepted by this Court in support of its final decision but in the present appeal we are not concerned with the claim for bonus and it is not necessary for us to refer to the said comment or to deal with it\\n\\nSo far as the decisions of the Industrial Tribunals are concerned it appears that the Labour Appellate Tribunal has held as early as 1952 that a hospital is an undertaking within the meaning of s 2j In 11957 SCR 33\\n\\nSri Vishuddhananda Saraswathi Marwari Hospital v Their Workmen 1 the Labour Appellate Tribunal considered at length the policy and object of the Act several judgments cited before it and came to the conclusion that the definition of industry in s 2j was of wide amplitude and that there was no good reason for cutting down its natural meaning so as to limit its operation to profitmaking enterprises only It has not been suggested before us that this view has ever been doubted or dissented from in any subsequent industrial adjudication\\n\\nIn judicial discussions about the scope and character of the concept of industry as it has developed in a modern democratic State the decision of the High Court of Australia in The Federated State School Teachers Association of Australia And The State of Victoria Ors 2 is generally cited In that case according to the majority decision it was held that the educational activities of the State carried on under the appropriate statutes and statutory regulations of each State relating to education did not constitute an industry with the meaning of s 4 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 19041928  that the occupation of teachers so employed was riot an industrial occupation and that the dispute which existed between the State and the teachers employed by them was therefore not an industrial dispute within s 51 xxxv of the Constitution Isaacs J however struck an emphatic note of dissent and the principles enunciated in this note of dissent have received approval from industrial tribunals in this country and they have been rightly accepted by the Bombay High Court as affording valuable assistance in deciding the question in the present proceedings Isaacs J has uttered a note of caution that in dealing with industrial disputes industrial adjudicators must be conversant with the current knowledge on the subject and they should not ignore the constant currents of life around them for otherwise it would introduce a serious infirmity in their approach Dealing with the general characteristics of industrial enterprises the learned judge observed 1 1952 II LLJ 327\\n\\n2 1929 4 CLR 569\\n\\nthat they contribute more or less to the general welfare of the community and he has reiterated his earlier observations on the point in these words Industrial disputes occur when in relation to operations in which capital and labour are contributed in cooperation for the satisfaction of human wants or desires those engaged in cooperation dispute as to basis to be observed by the parties engaged respecting either a share of the product or any other terms or conditions of their cooperation  According to the learned judge the question must always be decided by determing the true character of the activity in question It is these tests which the High Court has applied in deciding the present dispute and we are in general agreement with the decision of the High Court We ought to make it clear that in the present appeal we are not expressing any opinion on the question as to whether running an educational institution would be an industry under the Act that question does not arise in the present proceedings\\n\\nThere are two more decisions to which reference may be made before we part with this appeal In Brij Mohan Bagaria And Chatterjee NC  Ors 1 the Calcutta High Court was dealing with a dispute between an attorney of the court and some of his employees who bad been dismissed by him and it was held that the said dispute was outside the purview of the Act Sinha J who heard the petition filed by the attorney observed that  however extended the meaning be given to the word industry or to industrial dispute or to undertaking or calling we cannot include within their concept the case of an individual who carries on a profession dependent upon its own intellectual skill  The learned judge has then added that  every case must be decided upon its own facts  It appears that according to the learned judge if an attorney or a doctor or a lawyer who follows a liberal profession the pursuit of which depends upon his own education intellectual attainments and special equipment engages employees that would not mean that the employer is engaging in an industry under s 2j but with the question of the attorney or doctor 1 1958 11 LLJ 190\\n\\nor the lawyer we are not directly concerned in the present appeal We have however referred to this decision because in the course of discussion the learned judge has expressed his dissent from the view taken by the Bombay High Court in regard to hospitals and we wish to make it clear that in our opinion the criticism made by the learned judge against the inclusion of hospitals within s 2j is not wellfounded Dealing with a similar case of an attorney the Bombay High Court has taken the same view in National Union of Commercial Employees  Anr And Meher MR  Ors Pereira Fazalbhoy  Co 1 We would accordingly bold that the High Court was right in holding that the dispute between the appellant and the respondents was an industrial dispute to which s 251 of the Act applied The order passed by the High Court on the writ petition filed by the respondents is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs\\n\\nAppeal dismissed\\n'"

Respondents IQ and 3 were employed as Ward servants in the J. J. group of Hospitals. The superintendent of this said group of Hospitals informed the said respondents by notices issued respectively against them that their services would be terminated with effect from the dates mentioned in the said notices and in accordance with the said notices their services were in fact terminated;\\n\\nsubsequently in their place two State servants who were discharged from the Civil Supplies Department were appointed. The writ petition filed by the respondents alleged that the retrenchment of respondents 2 and 3 was void as it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of ss. 25F and 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947) (hereinafter called the Act) and it claimed a writ of mandamus directing the appellant to reinstate them in their posts. This petition was resisted by the appellant on several grounds. It was urged that the orders terminating the services of respondents 2 and 3 were not void and so the respondents\\' claim for a writ was unjustified on the merits and it was argued that the writ application was wholly misconceived inasmuch as the J. J group of Hospitals did not constitute an industry and so the relevant provisions of the Act were inapplicable to the respondent\\'s case. This writ petition was heard by Tendolkar J. The learned judge did not think it necessary to consider what he called the somewhat ticklish question as to whether the group of Hospitals constitutes an industry because he held that even assuming that the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable and could be invoked by the respondents it was not shown that the impugned orders were void. In his opinion non-compliance with the provisions of s. 251\\' did not invalidate the said orders, and it was open to the respondents to seek for an appropriate remedy under s. 251 of the Act. He also held that the question about the application of s. 25H did not arise. On these findings the writ petition filed by the respondents was dismissed. The matter was then taken before the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the impugned orders had not complied with the mandatory provisions of s. 25F and so they were invalid and inoperative. That is why the question as to whether s. 25H applied was not considered by it. The finding that the impugned orders were invalid for contravention of the mandatory provisions of s. 25F made it necessary to decide the larger issue as to whether the Act applied to the Hospitals. The Court of Appeal has observed that it was first inclined to send the matter back to Tendolkar J. but it was requested by the learned counsel appearing for both the parties that it Would be better if the said question was decided by it as it was a question of law and the decision of the said issue by the Court of Appeal would avoid a remand and a further appeal. That is how the issue was considered by the Court of Appeal and answered in favour of the respondents. In the result the decision of Tendolkar J. was reversed, the writ petition was allowed and a writ in the nature of mandamus was issued against the appellant.\\n\\nThe appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate of fitness from the Bombay High Court and with the said certificate it has brought the present appeal before us. On behalf of the appellant two points have been raised for our decision in the present appeal: Was the Appellate Court justified.in holding that the contravention of the material provisions of s. 25F of the Act rendered the impugned orders invalid; and do the relevant provisions of the Act apply to the group of Hospitals run by the appellant; are they an industry within the meaning of the Act ?\\n\\nBefore dealing with these points it would be relevant to state the material facts in regard to the group of Hospitals themselves which are not in dispute. This group consists of five Hospitals. It appears that in 1835 Sir Robert Grant, the then Governor of Bombay, desired to start an institution for the purposes of imparting medical education in the Presidency of Bombay. His proposal in that behalf was sanctioned by the Board of Directors of the East India Company and funds amounting to Rs. 44,000 were collected for the purpose and an equal amount was contributed by the Directors to defray the cost of construction of the College building. \\'In 1843 the foundation of the Medical College building was laid and the same was completed in 1845. About that time an idea of building a hospital for the sick people of all classes and castes was mooted and Sir Jamsetjee Jeejibboy offered donation and some contribution was made by the Government with which the J. J. Hospital was constructed and it was formally opened on May 15, 1845. Similarly the other four Hospitals in the group were built in course of time from donations. Except for a small amount of Rs. 10,000 the rest of the expenditure which is in the neighbourhood of Rs. 27 lakhs is entirely met by the appellant out of the grant sanctioned in the budget under the bead \" 38-Medical \". The group is under the administrative control of the Surgeon- General of the appellant and its day-to-day affairs are conducted and controlled by the Superintendent who is a full time employee of the appellant; the residential staff including the Resident Medical Officers, Assistant Medical Officers, Housemen, Nurses and others are all full-time employees of the -appellant and their salaries are drawn on the establishment pay bills every month and paid entirely by the appellant. This group serves as a clinical training ground for students of the Grant Medical College which is a Government Medical College run and . managed by the appellant for imparting medical sciences leading to the Degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of the Bombay University as well as various Post-Graduate qualifications of the said University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Bombay; the group is thus run and managed by the appellant to provide medical relief and to promote the health of the people of Bombay.\\n\\nNow, turning to the first point, it may be stated that the facts on which the respondents\\' plea is based are not in dispute. It is conceded that the services of respondents 2 and 3 have been retrenched though it may be for the purpose of making room for other Government servants with a longer record of service who had to be retrenched owing to the closure of the appellant\\',-, Civil Supplies Department,. It is also not disputed that the said respondents had not been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation as prescribed by s. 25F(b). The respondents\\' contention is that the failure to comply with the said requirement makes the order of retrenchment invalid. This plea has been upheld by the Court of Appeal. Section 25F (b) provides that no workman employed III in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall beretrenched by that employer until he has been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days\\' average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months. Clauses (a) and (c) of the said section prescribe similar conditions but we are not concerned with them. On a plain reading of s. 25F (b) it is clear that the requirement prescribed by it is a condition precedent for the retrenchment of the workman. The section provides that no workman shall be retrenched until the condition in question has been satisfied. It is difficult to accede to the argument that where the section imposes in mandatory terms a condition precedent, non-compliance with the said condition would not render the impugned retrenchment invalid. The argument which appealed to Tendolkar, J., however, was that the consequence of non-compliance with the requirement of s. 25F (b) was not to render the impugned retrenchment invalid, because be thought that by s. 251 a specific provision has been made for the recovery of the amount prescribed by s. 25F (b). Section 251 provides for the recovery of monies due from employers under Ch. V, and according to Tendolkor J. this provision covers the amount due to the workman by way of compensation under s. 25F (b). In our opinion, this view is untenable. Having regard to the fact that the words used in s. 25F (b) are mandatory and their effect is plain and unambiguous it seems to us that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that s. 251 covered cases of recover of ninnies other than those specified in s. 25F (b), an it is obvious that there are several other cases i which monies become due from the employers to th employees under Ch. V; it is for the recovery of the monies that s. 251 had been enacted. Therefore, we see no substance in the argument that the Court of Appeal has misconstrued s. 25F\\n\\n(b). That being so failure to comply with the said provision renders the impugned orders invalid and inoperative, Does the said provision apply to the present proceedings ? In other words, is the Act itself applicable to the group of Hospitals with which are concerned ? That is the next question which calls for an answer in the present appeal. Indeed it is this general question which has been strenuously argued before us by the learned Solicitor- General on behalf of the appellant. The decision of this question depends upon the interpretation of the definition of industry \" prescribed by s. 2(j) of the Act. Let us first read the definition. Section 2(j) providies that \\',industry\" means any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture of calling of employers and includes any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen. It would be noticed that the words used in the definition are very wide in their import and even so its latter part purports to provide an inclusive definition. The word \"undertaking\" according to Webster means\" anything undertaken ; any business, work or project which one engages in or attempts, an enterprise \". Similarly, \" trade \" according to Halsbury, in its primary meaning, is \" exchange of goods for goods or goods for money \", and in its secondary meaning it is \" any business carried on with a view to profit whether manual or mercantile, as distinguished from the liberal arts or learned professions and from agriculture \"; whereas \" business \" is a wider term not synonymous with trade and means practically \" anything which is an occupation as distinguished from a pleasure The word SC calling \" again is very wide; it means`one\\'s usual occupation, vocation, business or trade\"; so is the word \"service\" very wide in its import. Prima facie, if the definition has deliberately used words of such wide import, it would be necessary to read those words in their wide denotation; and so read, Hospitals cannot be excluded from the definition.\\n\\nIt is, however, contended that, in construing the definition, we must adopt the rule of construction noscuntur a sociis. This rule, according to Maxwell, means that, when two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled toge-\\n\\nther they are understood to be used in their cognate sense. They take is it were their colour from each other, that is, the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to a less general. The same rule is thus interpreted in \" Words and Phrases \" (Vol. XIV, P. 207): \" Associated words take their meaning from one another under the doctrine of noscuntur a sociis, the philosophy of which is that the meaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it; such doctrine is broader than the maxim Ejusdem Generis.\" In fact the latter I maxim \"is only an illustration or specific application of the broader maxim noscuntur a sociis \". The argument is that certain essential features or attributes are invariably associated with the words \" business and trade \" as understood in the popular and conventional sense, and it is the colour of these attributes which is taken by the other words used in the definition though their normal import may be much wider. We are not impressed by this argument. It must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider. 1 is only where the intention of the Legislature i associating wider words with words of narrow significance is doubtful, or otherwise not clear that the present rule of construction can be useful applied. It can also be applied where the meaning of the words of wider import is doubtful; but, where the object of the Legislature in using wider words i clear and free of ambiguity, the rule of construction in question cannot be pressed into service. As ha been observed by Earl of Halsbury, L. C., in The Corporation of Glasgow v. Glasgow Tramway an Omnibus Co. Ltd. (1), in dealing with the wider word used in s. 6 of Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Act, 1854 \" the words \\'free from all expenses whatever i connection with the said tramways\\' appear to me to be so wide in their application that I should have thought it impossible to qualify or cut them down by their being associated with other words on the (1) (1898) A.C 63, at p. 634.\\n\\nprinciple of their being ejusdem generis with the previous words enumerated \". If the object and scope -of the statute are considered there would be no difficulty in holding that the relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the Legislature in defining \" industry\" in s. 2(j). The object of the Act was to make provision for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes, and the extent and scope of its provisions would be realised if we bear in mind the definition of \" industrial dispute \" given by s. 2(k), of \" wagesby s. 2(rr), \" workman \" by s. 2(s), and of \" employer by s. 2(g). Besides, the definition of public utility service prescribed by s. 2(m) is very significant. One has merely to glance at the six categories of public utility service mentioned by s. 2(m) to realise that the rule of construction on which the appellant relies is inapplicable in interpreting the definition prescribed by s. 2(j).\\n\\nThere is another point which cannot be ignored. Section 2(j) does not define \" industry \" in the usual manner by prescribing what it means: the first clause of the definition gives the statutory meaning of \" industry \" and the second clause deliberately refers to several other items of industry and brings them in the definition in an inclusive way. It is obvious that the words used in an inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated as restricted in any sense. (Vide: Stroud\\'s \" Judicial Dictionary \", Vol. 2, p. 1415). Where we are dealing with an inclusive definition it would be inappropriate to put a restrictive interpretation upon terms of wider denotation. Besides, it would be relevant to point out that too much reliance cannot be placed on what are described as the essential attributes or features of trade or business as conventionally understood. The conventional meaning attributed to the words \"trade and business\" has lost some of it validity for the purpose of industrial adjudication. Industrial adjudication has necessarily to be aware of the current of socioeconomic thought around; it must recogiiise that in the modern welfare State healthy industrial relations are a matter of paramount import-\\n\\nance and its essential function is to assist the State by helping a solution of industrial disputes which constitute a distinct and persistent phenomenon of modern ~industrialised States. ~In attempting to solve industrial disputes industrial adjudication does not and should not adopt a ~doctrinnaire approach. It must evolve some working principles and should generally avoid formulating or adopting abstract generalisations. Nevertheless it cannot harp back to old-age notions about the relations between employer and employee or to the doctrine of laissez faire which then governed the regulation of the said relations. That is why, we think, in construing the wide words used in s. 2(j) it would be erroneous to attach undue importance to attributes associated with business or trade in the popular mind in days gone by.\\n\\nIt is clear, however, that though s. 2(j) uses words of very wide denotation, a line would have to be drawn in a fair and just manner so as to exclude some callings, services or undertakings. If all the words used are given their widest meaning, all services and all callings would come within the purview of the definition; even service rendered by a servant purely in a personal or domestic matter or even in a casual way would fall within the definition. It is not and cannot be suggested that in its wide sweep the word \"service\" is intended to include service howsoever rendered in whatsoever capacity and for whatsoever reason. We must, therefore, consider where the line should be drawn and what limitations can and should be reasonably implied in interpreting the wide words used in s. 2(j); and that no doubt is a somewhat difficult problem to decide. It is true that under the old-world notion prevailing under the capitalist form of society industry generally means an economic activity involving investment of capital systematically carried on for profit for the production or sale of goods by the employment of labour. When it is urged by the appellant that an undertaking should be analogous to trade or business what is really intended is that unless the undertaking in question shares the aforesaid essential features associated with the conventional notion of trade or business it should not be treated as falling under s. 2(j). There are two serious difficulties in accepting such a suggestion, and indeed the appellant concedes the presence of these two difficulties. It is not disputed that under s. 2(j) an activity can and must be regarded as an industry even though in carrying it out profit motive may be absent. It is also common ground that the absence of investment of any capital would not make a material difference to the applicability of s. 2(j). Thus, two of the important attributes conventionally associated with trade or business are not necessarily predicated in interpreting s. 2(j). What then can be said to be the attributes or features which should be common between trade and business on the one hand and an undertaking and other items mentioned in s. 2(j) on the other ?\\n\\nIt would be possible to exclude some activities from s. 2(j) without any difficulty. Negatively stated the activities of the Government which can be properly described as regal or sovereign activities are outsidly the scope of s. 2(j). These are functions which a constitutional Government can and must undertake for governance and which no private citizen can undertake. This position is not in dispute. An attempt is, however, made by the appellant to suggest that in view of the Directive Principles enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution and in view of the ideal of a welfare State which has been placed before the country, Governments, both at the level of the States as well as at the Centre, undertake several welfare activities; and the argument is that the field of governmental or regal activities which are excluded from the operation of s. 2(j) should be extended to cover other activities undertaken by the Governments in pursuit of their welfare policies. In our opinion, this contention cannot be accepted . The activities which do not fall within s. 2(j) and which are described as governmental or regal or sovereign have been pithily described by Lord Watson as \"the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional Government\" (Vide: Coomber v. Justices of Berks(1) ); and it is only these activities that are outside the scope of s. 2(j). It sounds incongruous and self- contradictory (1) (1883) App. cas. 61.\\n\\nto suggest that activities undertaken by the Government in the interests of socioeconomic progress of the country as beneficial measures should be exempted from the operation of the Act which in substance is a very important beneficial measure itself In this connection it would be relevant to point out that the definition of the word \"employer\" given by s. 2(g) is not without significance: an \"employer\" means under s. 2(g)(i) \"in relation to an industry carried on by or under the authority of any department of the Central Government or State Government authority prescribed in this behalf, or where no authority is prescribed the head of the department.\" This definition clearly indicates that the Legislature intended the application of the Act to activities of the Government which fall within s. 2(j). In considering the question as to whether the group of Hospitals run by the appellant undoubtedly for the purpose of giving medical relief to the citizens and for helping to impart medical education are an undertaking or not, it would be pertinent to enquire whether an activity of a like nature would be an undertaking if it is carried on by a private citizen or a group of private citizens. There is no doubt that if a hospital is run by private citizens for profit it would be an undertaking very much like the trade or business in their conventional sense. We have already stated that the presence of profit motive is not essential for bringing an undertaking within s. 2 (j). If that be so, if a private citizen runs a hospital without charging any fees from the patients treated in it would nevertheless be an undertaking under s. 2(j). Thus the character of the activity involved in running a hospital brings the institution of the hospital within s. 2(j). Does it make any difference that the hospital is run by the Government in the interpretation of the word \"undertaking\" in s. 2(j) ? In our opinion, the answer to this question must be in the negative. It is the character of the activity which decides the question as to whether the activity in question attracts the provision of s. 2(j); who conducts the activity and whether it is conducted for profit or not do not make a material difference.\\n\\nWe have yet to decide which are the attributes the presence of which makes in activity an under taking within s. 2(j), on the ground that it is analogous to trade or business. It is difficult to state these possible, attributes definitely or exhaustively; as a working principle it may be stated that an activity systematically or habitually undertaken for the production or distribution of goods or for the rendering of material services to the community at large or a part of such community with the help of employees -is an. undertaking. Such an activity generally involves the co- operation of the employer and the employees; and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs. It must be organised or arranged in a manner in which trade or business is generally organised or arranged. It must not be casual nor must it be for oneself nor for pleasure. Thus the manner in which the activity in question is organised or arranged, the condition of the co-operation between employer and the employee necessary for its success and its object to render material service to the community can be regarded as some of the features which are distinctive of activities to which s. 2(j) applies. Judged by this test there would be no difficulty in holding that the State is carrying on an undertaking when it runs the group of Hospitals in question. Is quid pro quo necessary for bringing an activity under s. 2(j) ? It has been urged before us that though profit motive may not be essential, it is nevertheless necessary that the person who carries on the activity should receive some consideration in return ; and it is only if the test of quid pro quo is satisfied that an activity should be treated as an undertaking. Though this argument is put in a slightly different form, in substance it is really based on the idea that profit motive is necessary to make any activity an undertaking analogous to trade or, business. If the absence of profit motive is immaterial why should an activity be excluded from s. 2(j) merely because the person responsible for the conduct of the activity expects no consideration, does not want any quid pro quo and is actuated by philanthropic or charitable motive ? In our opinion, in deciding the question as to whether any activity in question is an undertaking under s. 2(j) the doctrine of quid pro quo can have no application. Therefore, we are satisfied that the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the conduct and running of the group of Hospitals by the appellant amounted to an undertaking under s. 2 (j) and the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable. In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the fact that in the First Schedule to the Act which enumerates industries which may be declared as public utility service under s. 2(n)(vi), three entries have been added by Act 36 of 1956. They are Defence Establishment, services in hospitals and dispensaries, and Fire, Brigade service. In other words, by the addition of these three entries the Leo- islature has clearly indicated its intention that service in hospitals and dispensaries can be declared to be a public utility service under s. 2(n)(vi); and there is no doubt that unless the service in hospitals falls under s. 2(j) and is treated as an industry it cannot be declared to be a public utility service. It is true that this particular entry had not been included in the First Schedule at the time when the present reference wag made, but its subsequent inclusion can be reasonably taken as evidence of legislative intention, and, if on a construction of s. 2(j) we have independently reached the conclusion that service in hospitals is service or the conduct of hospitals is an undertaking, we may reasonably seek to derive corroboration to our conclusion by this subsequent legislative enactment,. After the addition of the relevant entry in the First Schedule it would not be open to anybody to suggest that service in hospitals does not fall under s. 2(j). It now remains to consider some of the decisions to which our attention was invited. In D. N. Banerji v. P. R. Mukherjee & Ors. (1), this Court was dealing with a a industrial dispute raised by the Municipal Workers\\' Union of the Budge Budge Municipality, on behalf of the Sanitary Inspector and Head Clerk of the said Municipality on the ground that the dismissal of the said two Municipal employees was unjustified and (1)[1953] S.C.R. 302.\\n\\nillegal, and that they were entitled to an order of reinstatement. The dispute thus referred to the Industrial Tribunal was decided in favour of the Union and an award was made directing the Municipality to reinstate the said two employees. The Municipality then took the matter to the High Court at Calcutta by means of a petition for a writ of certiorari under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution. It was urged in support of the petition that the Act was inapplicable to the dispute in question and that there was really no industrial dispute which could be validly referred to the Industrial Tribunal. Other contentions were also raised but it is unnecessary to refer to them. The High Court rejected all the pleas raised by the Municipality and dismissed the application for a writ. The Municipality then brought the dispute to this Court under Art. 132(1) of the Constitution. This Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the Municipality and confirmed the order of the High Court. In dealing with the appeal this Court laid down certain propositions which are relevant for our purpose in the present appeal. It was observed that \" in determining the meaning of the word \" industry \" and \" industrial dispute \" it was necessary to leave aside the original meaning attributed to the words in a simpler state of society; then the contention of the Municipality that its activities in question did not amount to an industry were dealt with in these words: \" The only ground on which one could say that what would amount to the carrying on of an industry if it is done by a private person ceases to be so if the same work is carried on by a local body like the Municipality is that in the latter there is nothing like the investment of any capital or the existence of a profit earning notice as there generally is in a business. But neither the one nor the other seems a sine qua non or necessary element in the modern conception of industry \". It is because of this positive decision that the appellant has fairly conceded in the course of the argument before us that the absence of the profit motive or of investment of capital would not make a material difference in determinig the character of an activity this court has also examined the other relevant factors pertaining to the construction of the word \" industry \" and industry dispute\" and has declared its decision thus; Having regard to the definitions found In our Act the aim or objective that the Legislature had in view and the nature, variety and range of disputes that occur between employers and employees, were forced to the conclusion that the definitions in our Act include also disputes that right arise between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be said to be analogy to the carrying out of a trade or business \". In the present appeal we have to decide the question as to \",hat attributes or features can be said to make an activity in question analogous to trade or business. Incidentally we may add that quite apart from the relevant considerations which we have already discussed it would be difficult to suggest that though the sanitary department of a local body is an undertaking under s. 2(j) a hospital run by a Government is not.\\n\\nThis decision has been referred to by this, Court in Baroda Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen (1), and it has been observed that it is now finally settled that a municipal undertaking of the nature with which the court was then concerned is an industry within the meaning of the definition of that word in s. 2(j) of the Act and that the expression\" industrial dispute \" in that Act includes disputes between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be regarded as analogous to the carrying on of a trade or business. In that case this Court was concerned with the claim for bonus made by the workmen of the Baroda Borough Municipality and it was rejected; comment has been made by learned counsel on some of the grounds accepted by this Court in support of its final decision, but in the present appeal we are not concerned with the claim for bonus and it is not necessary for us to refer to the said comment or to deal with it.\\n\\nSo far as the decisions of the Industrial Tribunals are concerned it appears that the Labour Appellate Tribunal has held as early as 1952 that a hospital is an undertaking within the meaning of s. 2(j). In (1)[1957] S.C.R. 33.\\n\\nSri Vishuddhananda Saraswathi Marwari Hospital v. Their Workmen (1) the, Labour Appellate Tribunal considered at length the policy and object of the Act, several judgments cited before it and came to the conclusion that the definition of industry in s. 2(j) was of wide amplitude and that there was no good reason for cutting down its natural meaning so as to limit its operation to profit-making enterprises only. It has not been suggested before us that this view has ever been doubted or dissented from in any subsequent industrial adjudication.\\n\\nIn judicial discussions about the scope and character of the concept of industry as it has developed in a modern democratic State the decision of the High Court of Australia in The Federated State School Teachers\\' Association of Australia And The State of Victoria& Ors (2), is generally cited. In that case, according to the majority decision it was held that the educational activities of the State carried on under the appropriate statutes and statutory regulations of each State relating to education did not constitute an industry with the meaning of s. 4 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1904-1928 ; that the occupation of teachers so employed was riot an industrial occupation; and that the dispute which existed between the State and the teachers employed by them was therefore, not an industrial dispute within s. 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution. Isaacs J., however, struck an emphatic note of dissent, and the principles enunciated in this note of dissent have received approval from industrial tribunals in this country, and they have been rightly accepted by the Bombay High Court as affording valuable assistance in deciding the question in the present proceedings. Isaacs J. has uttered a note of caution that in dealing with industrial disputes industrial adjudicators must be conversant with the current knowledge on the subject and they should not ignore the constant currents of life, around them for otherwise it would introduce a serious infirmity in their approach. Dealing with the general characteristics of industrial enterprises the learned judge observed (1) [1952] II L.L.J. 327.\\n\\n(2) [1929] 4 C.L.R. 569.\\n\\nthat they contribute more or less to the general welfare of the community; and he has reiterated his earlier observations on the point in these words: \"Industrial disputes occur when in relation to operations in which capital and labour are contributed in co-operation for the satisfaction of human wants or desires, those engaged in co-operation dispute as to basis to be observed by the parties engaged, respecting either a share of the product or any other terms or conditions of their co-operation \". According to the learned judge, the question must always be decided by determing the true character of the activity in question. It is these tests which the High Court has applied in deciding the present dispute and we are in general agreement with the decision of the High Court. We ought to make it clear that in the present appeal we are not expressing any opinion on the question as to whether running an educational institution would be an industry under the Act; that question does not arise in the present proceedings.\\n\\nThere are two more decisions to which reference may be made before we part with this appeal. In Brij Mohan Bagaria And Chatterjee (N.C.) & Ors. (1), the Calcutta High Court was dealing with a dispute between an attorney of the court and some of his employees who bad been dismissed by him; and it was held that the said dispute was outside the purview of the Act. Sinha J., who heard the petition filed by the attorney, observed that \" however extended the meaning be given to the word industry or to industrial dispute or to undertaking or calling we cannot include within their concept the case of an individual who carries on a profession dependent upon its own intellectual skill \". The learned judge has then added that \" every case must be decided upon its own facts \". It appears that, according to the learned judge, if an attorney or a doctor or a lawyer who follows a liberal profession, the pursuit of which depends upon his own education, intellectual attainments and special equipment, engages employees, that would not mean that the employer is engaging in an industry under s. 2(j); but with the question of the attorney or doctor (1) (1958) 11 L.L.J. 190.\\n\\nor the lawyer we are not directly concerned in the present appeal. We have, however, referred to this decision because, in the course of discussion, the learned judge has expressed his dissent from the view taken by the Bombay High Court in regard to hospitals, and we wish to make it clear that, in our opinion, the criticism made by the learned judge against the inclusion of hospitals within s. 2(j) is not well-founded. Dealing with a similar case of an attorney, the Bombay High Court has taken the same view in National Union of Commercial Employees & Anr. And Meher (M.R.) & Ors. (Pereira Fazalbhoy & Co.) (1). We would accordingly bold that the High Court was right in holding that the dispute between the appellant and the respondents was an industrial dispute to which s. 251\\' of the Act applied. The order passed by the High Court on the writ petition filed by the respondents is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs.\\n\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n'"

Respondents IQ and 3 were employed as Ward servants in the J. J. group of Hospitals. The superintendent of this said group of Hospitals informed the said respondents by notices issued respectively against them that their services would be terminated with effect from the dates mentioned in the said notices and in accordance with the said notices their services were in fact terminated;\\n\\nsubsequently in their place two State servants who were discharged from the Civil Supplies Department were appointed. The writ petition filed by the respondents alleged that the retrenchment of respondents 2 and 3 was void as it did not comply with the mandatory provisions of ss. 25F and 25H of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (14 of 1947) (hereinafter called the Act) and it claimed a writ of mandamus directing the appellant to reinstate them in their posts. This petition was resisted by the appellant on several grounds. It was urged that the orders terminating the services of respondents 2 and 3 were not void and so the respondents\\' claim for a writ was unjustified on the merits and it was argued that the writ application was wholly misconceived inasmuch as the J. J group of Hospitals did not constitute an industry and so the relevant provisions of the Act were inapplicable to the respondent\\'s case. This writ petition was heard by Tendolkar J. The learned judge did not think it necessary to consider what he called the somewhat ticklish question as to whether the group of Hospitals constitutes an industry because he held that even assuming that the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable and could be invoked by the respondents it was not shown that the impugned orders were void. In his opinion non-compliance with the provisions of s. 251\\' did not invalidate the said orders, and it was open to the respondents to seek for an appropriate remedy under s. 251 of the Act. He also held that the question about the application of s. 25H did not arise. On these findings the writ petition filed by the respondents was dismissed. The matter was then taken before the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the impugned orders had not complied with the mandatory provisions of s. 25F and so they were invalid and inoperative. That is why the question as to whether s. 25H applied was not considered by it. The finding that the impugned orders were invalid for contravention of the mandatory provisions of s. 25F made it necessary to decide the larger issue as to whether the Act applied to the Hospitals. The Court of Appeal has observed that it was first inclined to send the matter back to Tendolkar J. but it was requested by the learned counsel appearing for both the parties that it Would be better if the said question was decided by it as it was a question of law and the decision of the said issue by the Court of Appeal would avoid a remand and a further appeal. That is how the issue was considered by the Court of Appeal and answered in favour of the respondents. In the result the decision of Tendolkar J. was reversed, the writ petition was allowed and a writ in the nature of mandamus was issued against the appellant.\\n\\nThe appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate of fitness from the Bombay High Court and with the said certificate it has brought the present appeal before us. On behalf of the appellant two points have been raised for our decision in the present appeal: Was the Appellate Court justified.in holding that the contravention of the material provisions of s. 25F of the Act rendered the impugned orders invalid; and do the relevant provisions of the Act apply to the group of Hospitals run by the appellant; are they an industry within the meaning of the Act ?\\n\\nBefore dealing with these points it would be relevant to state the material facts in regard to the group of Hospitals themselves which are not in dispute. This group consists of five Hospitals. It appears that in 1835 Sir Robert Grant, the then Governor of Bombay, desired to start an institution for the purposes of imparting medical education in the Presidency of Bombay. His proposal in that behalf was sanctioned by the Board of Directors of the East India Company and funds amounting to Rs. 44,000 were collected for the purpose and an equal amount was contributed by the Directors to defray the cost of construction of the College building. \\'In 1843 the foundation of the Medical College building was laid and the same was completed in 1845. About that time an idea of building a hospital for the sick people of all classes and castes was mooted and Sir Jamsetjee Jeejibboy offered donation and some contribution was made by the Government with which the J. J. Hospital was constructed and it was formally opened on May 15, 1845. Similarly the other four Hospitals in the group were built in course of time from donations. Except for a small amount of Rs. 10,000 the rest of the expenditure which is in the neighbourhood of Rs. 27 lakhs is entirely met by the appellant out of the grant sanctioned in the budget under the bead \" 38-Medical \". The group is under the administrative control of the Surgeon- General of the appellant and its day-to-day affairs are conducted and controlled by the Superintendent who is a full time employee of the appellant; the residential staff including the Resident Medical Officers, Assistant Medical Officers, Housemen, Nurses and others are all full-time employees of the -appellant and their salaries are drawn on the establishment pay bills every month and paid entirely by the appellant. This group serves as a clinical training ground for students of the Grant Medical College which is a Government Medical College run and . managed by the appellant for imparting medical sciences leading to the Degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery of the Bombay University as well as various Post-Graduate qualifications of the said University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Bombay; the group is thus run and managed by the appellant to provide medical relief and to promote the health of the people of Bombay.\\n\\nNow, turning to the first point, it may be stated that the facts on which the respondents\\' plea is based are not in dispute. It is conceded that the services of respondents 2 and 3 have been retrenched though it may be for the purpose of making room for other Government servants with a longer record of service who had to be retrenched owing to the closure of the appellant\\',-, Civil Supplies Department,. It is also not disputed that the said respondents had not been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation as prescribed by s. 25F(b). The respondents\\' contention is that the failure to comply with the said requirement makes the order of retrenchment invalid. This plea has been upheld by the Court of Appeal. Section 25F (b) provides that no workman employed III in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall beretrenched by that employer until he has been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days\\' average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months. Clauses (a) and (c) of the said section prescribe similar conditions but we are not concerned with them. On a plain reading of s. 25F (b) it is clear that the requirement prescribed by it is a condition precedent for the retrenchment of the workman. The section provides that no workman shall be retrenched until the condition in question has been satisfied. It is difficult to accede to the argument that where the section imposes in mandatory terms a condition precedent, non-compliance with the said condition would not render the impugned retrenchment invalid. The argument which appealed to Tendolkar, J., however, was that the consequence of non-compliance with the requirement of s. 25F (b) was not to render the impugned retrenchment invalid, because be thought that by s. 251 a specific provision has been made for the recovery of the amount prescribed by s. 25F (b). Section 251 provides for the recovery of monies due from employers under Ch. V, and according to Tendolkor J. this provision covers the amount due to the workman by way of compensation under s. 25F (b). In our opinion, this view is untenable. Having regard to the fact that the words used in s. 25F (b) are mandatory and their effect is plain and unambiguous it seems to us that the Court of Appeal was right in holding that s. 251 covered cases of recover of ninnies other than those specified in s. 25F (b), an it is obvious that there are several other cases i which monies become due from the employers to th employees under Ch. V; it is for the recovery of the monies that s. 251 had been enacted. Therefore, we see no substance in the argument that the Court of Appeal has misconstrued s. 25F\\n\\n(b). That being so failure to comply with the said provision renders the impugned orders invalid and inoperative, Does the said provision apply to the present proceedings ? In other words, is the Act itself applicable to the group of Hospitals with which are concerned ? That is the next question which calls for an answer in the present appeal. Indeed it is this general question which has been strenuously argued before us by the learned Solicitor- General on behalf of the appellant. The decision of this question depends upon the interpretation of the definition of industry \" prescribed by s. 2(j) of the Act. Let us first read the definition. Section 2(j) providies that \\',industry\" means any business, trade, undertaking, manufacture of calling of employers and includes any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen. It would be noticed that the words used in the definition are very wide in their import and even so its latter part purports to provide an inclusive definition. The word \"undertaking\" according to Webster means\" anything undertaken ; any business, work or project which one engages in or attempts, an enterprise \". Similarly, \" trade \" according to Halsbury, in its primary meaning, is \" exchange of goods for goods or goods for money \", and in its secondary meaning it is \" any business carried on with a view to profit whether manual or mercantile, as distinguished from the liberal arts or learned professions and from agriculture \"; whereas \" business \" is a wider term not synonymous with trade and means practically \" anything which is an occupation as distinguished from a pleasure The word SC calling \" again is very wide; it means`one\\'s usual occupation, vocation, business or trade\"; so is the word \"service\" very wide in its import. Prima facie, if the definition has deliberately used words of such wide import, it would be necessary to read those words in their wide denotation; and so read, Hospitals cannot be excluded from the definition.\\n\\nIt is, however, contended that, in construing the definition, we must adopt the rule of construction noscuntur a sociis. This rule, according to Maxwell, means that, when two or more words which are susceptible of analogous meaning are coupled toge-\\n\\nther they are understood to be used in their cognate sense. They take is it were their colour from each other, that is, the more general is restricted to a sense analogous to a less general. The same rule is thus interpreted in \" Words and Phrases \" (Vol. XIV, P. 207): \" Associated words take their meaning from one another under the doctrine of noscuntur a sociis, the philosophy of which is that the meaning of a doubtful word may be ascertained by reference to the meaning of words associated with it; such doctrine is broader than the maxim Ejusdem Generis.\" In fact the latter I maxim \"is only an illustration or specific application of the broader maxim noscuntur a sociis \". The argument is that certain essential features or attributes are invariably associated with the words \" business and trade \" as understood in the popular and conventional sense, and it is the colour of these attributes which is taken by the other words used in the definition though their normal import may be much wider. We are not impressed by this argument. It must be borne in mind that noscuntur a sociis is merely a rule of construction and it cannot prevail in cases where it is clear that the wider words have been deliberately used in order to make the scope of the defined word correspondingly wider. 1 is only where the intention of the Legislature i associating wider words with words of narrow significance is doubtful, or otherwise not clear that the present rule of construction can be useful applied. It can also be applied where the meaning of the words of wider import is doubtful; but, where the object of the Legislature in using wider words i clear and free of ambiguity, the rule of construction in question cannot be pressed into service. As ha been observed by Earl of Halsbury, L. C., in The Corporation of Glasgow v. Glasgow Tramway an Omnibus Co. Ltd. (1), in dealing with the wider word used in s. 6 of Valuation of Lands (Scotland) Act, 1854 \" the words \\'free from all expenses whatever i connection with the said tramways\\' appear to me to be so wide in their application that I should have thought it impossible to qualify or cut them down by their being associated with other words on the (1) (1898) A.C 63, at p. 634.\\n\\nprinciple of their being ejusdem generis with the previous words enumerated \". If the object and scope -of the statute are considered there would be no difficulty in holding that the relevant words of wide import have been deliberately used by the Legislature in defining \" industry\" in s. 2(j). The object of the Act was to make provision for the investigation and settlement of industrial disputes, and the extent and scope of its provisions would be realised if we bear in mind the definition of \" industrial dispute \" given by s. 2(k), of \" wagesby s. 2(rr), \" workman \" by s. 2(s), and of \" employer by s. 2(g). Besides, the definition of public utility service prescribed by s. 2(m) is very significant. One has merely to glance at the six categories of public utility service mentioned by s. 2(m) to realise that the rule of construction on which the appellant relies is inapplicable in interpreting the definition prescribed by s. 2(j).\\n\\nThere is another point which cannot be ignored. Section 2(j) does not define \" industry \" in the usual manner by prescribing what it means: the first clause of the definition gives the statutory meaning of \" industry \" and the second clause deliberately refers to several other items of industry and brings them in the definition in an inclusive way. It is obvious that the words used in an inclusive definition denote extension and cannot be treated as restricted in any sense. (Vide: Stroud\\'s \" Judicial Dictionary \", Vol. 2, p. 1415). Where we are dealing with an inclusive definition it would be inappropriate to put a restrictive interpretation upon terms of wider denotation. Besides, it would be relevant to point out that too much reliance cannot be placed on what are described as the essential attributes or features of trade or business as conventionally understood. The conventional meaning attributed to the words \"trade and business\" has lost some of it validity for the purpose of industrial adjudication. Industrial adjudication has necessarily to be aware of the current of socioeconomic thought around; it must recogiiise that in the modern welfare State healthy industrial relations are a matter of paramount import-\\n\\nance and its essential function is to assist the State by helping a solution of industrial disputes which constitute a distinct and persistent phenomenon of modern ~industrialised States. ~In attempting to solve industrial disputes industrial adjudication does not and should not adopt a ~doctrinnaire approach. It must evolve some working principles and should generally avoid formulating or adopting abstract generalisations. Nevertheless it cannot harp back to old-age notions about the relations between employer and employee or to the doctrine of laissez faire which then governed the regulation of the said relations. That is why, we think, in construing the wide words used in s. 2(j) it would be erroneous to attach undue importance to attributes associated with business or trade in the popular mind in days gone by.\\n\\nIt is clear, however, that though s. 2(j) uses words of very wide denotation, a line would have to be drawn in a fair and just manner so as to exclude some callings, services or undertakings. If all the words used are given their widest meaning, all services and all callings would come within the purview of the definition; even service rendered by a servant purely in a personal or domestic matter or even in a casual way would fall within the definition. It is not and cannot be suggested that in its wide sweep the word \"service\" is intended to include service howsoever rendered in whatsoever capacity and for whatsoever reason. We must, therefore, consider where the line should be drawn and what limitations can and should be reasonably implied in interpreting the wide words used in s. 2(j); and that no doubt is a somewhat difficult problem to decide. It is true that under the old-world notion prevailing under the capitalist form of society industry generally means an economic activity involving investment of capital systematically carried on for profit for the production or sale of goods by the employment of labour. When it is urged by the appellant that an undertaking should be analogous to trade or business what is really intended is that unless the undertaking in question shares the aforesaid essential features associated with the conventional notion of trade or business it should not be treated as falling under s. 2(j). There are two serious difficulties in accepting such a suggestion, and indeed the appellant concedes the presence of these two difficulties. It is not disputed that under s. 2(j) an activity can and must be regarded as an industry even though in carrying it out profit motive may be absent. It is also common ground that the absence of investment of any capital would not make a material difference to the applicability of s. 2(j). Thus, two of the important attributes conventionally associated with trade or business are not necessarily predicated in interpreting s. 2(j). What then can be said to be the attributes or features which should be common between trade and business on the one hand and an undertaking and other items mentioned in s. 2(j) on the other ?\\n\\nIt would be possible to exclude some activities from s. 2(j) without any difficulty. Negatively stated the activities of the Government which can be properly described as regal or sovereign activities are outsidly the scope of s. 2(j). These are functions which a constitutional Government can and must undertake for governance and which no private citizen can undertake. This position is not in dispute. An attempt is, however, made by the appellant to suggest that in view of the Directive Principles enunciated in Part IV of the Constitution and in view of the ideal of a welfare State which has been placed before the country, Governments, both at the level of the States as well as at the Centre, undertake several welfare activities; and the argument is that the field of governmental or regal activities which are excluded from the operation of s. 2(j) should be extended to cover other activities undertaken by the Governments in pursuit of their welfare policies. In our opinion, this contention cannot be accepted . The activities which do not fall within s. 2(j) and which are described as governmental or regal or sovereign have been pithily described by Lord Watson as \"the primary and inalienable functions of a constitutional Government\" (Vide: Coomber v. Justices of Berks(1) ); and it is only these activities that are outside the scope of s. 2(j). It sounds incongruous and self- contradictory (1) (1883) App. cas. 61.\\n\\nto suggest that activities undertaken by the Government in the interests of socioeconomic progress of the country as beneficial measures should be exempted from the operation of the Act which in substance is a very important beneficial measure itself In this connection it would be relevant to point out that the definition of the word \"employer\" given by s. 2(g) is not without significance: an \"employer\" means under s. 2(g)(i) \"in relation to an industry carried on by or under the authority of any department of the Central Government or State Government authority prescribed in this behalf, or where no authority is prescribed the head of the department.\" This definition clearly indicates that the Legislature intended the application of the Act to activities of the Government which fall within s. 2(j). In considering the question as to whether the group of Hospitals run by the appellant undoubtedly for the purpose of giving medical relief to the citizens and for helping to impart medical education are an undertaking or not, it would be pertinent to enquire whether an activity of a like nature would be an undertaking if it is carried on by a private citizen or a group of private citizens. There is no doubt that if a hospital is run by private citizens for profit it would be an undertaking very much like the trade or business in their conventional sense. We have already stated that the presence of profit motive is not essential for bringing an undertaking within s. 2 (j). If that be so, if a private citizen runs a hospital without charging any fees from the patients treated in it would nevertheless be an undertaking under s. 2(j). Thus the character of the activity involved in running a hospital brings the institution of the hospital within s. 2(j). Does it make any difference that the hospital is run by the Government in the interpretation of the word \"undertaking\" in s. 2(j) ? In our opinion, the answer to this question must be in the negative. It is the character of the activity which decides the question as to whether the activity in question attracts the provision of s. 2(j); who conducts the activity and whether it is conducted for profit or not do not make a material difference.\\n\\nWe have yet to decide which are the attributes the presence of which makes in activity an under taking within s. 2(j), on the ground that it is analogous to trade or business. It is difficult to state these possible, attributes definitely or exhaustively; as a working principle it may be stated that an activity systematically or habitually undertaken for the production or distribution of goods or for the rendering of material services to the community at large or a part of such community with the help of employees -is an. undertaking. Such an activity generally involves the co- operation of the employer and the employees; and its object is the satisfaction of material human needs. It must be organised or arranged in a manner in which trade or business is generally organised or arranged. It must not be casual nor must it be for oneself nor for pleasure. Thus the manner in which the activity in question is organised or arranged, the condition of the co-operation between employer and the employee necessary for its success and its object to render material service to the community can be regarded as some of the features which are distinctive of activities to which s. 2(j) applies. Judged by this test there would be no difficulty in holding that the State is carrying on an undertaking when it runs the group of Hospitals in question. Is quid pro quo necessary for bringing an activity under s. 2(j) ? It has been urged before us that though profit motive may not be essential, it is nevertheless necessary that the person who carries on the activity should receive some consideration in return ; and it is only if the test of quid pro quo is satisfied that an activity should be treated as an undertaking. Though this argument is put in a slightly different form, in substance it is really based on the idea that profit motive is necessary to make any activity an undertaking analogous to trade or, business. If the absence of profit motive is immaterial why should an activity be excluded from s. 2(j) merely because the person responsible for the conduct of the activity expects no consideration, does not want any quid pro quo and is actuated by philanthropic or charitable motive ? In our opinion, in deciding the question as to whether any activity in question is an undertaking under s. 2(j) the doctrine of quid pro quo can have no application. Therefore, we are satisfied that the High Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the conduct and running of the group of Hospitals by the appellant amounted to an undertaking under s. 2 (j) and the relevant provisions of the Act were applicable. In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the fact that in the First Schedule to the Act which enumerates industries which may be declared as public utility service under s. 2(n)(vi), three entries have been added by Act 36 of 1956. They are Defence Establishment, services in hospitals and dispensaries, and Fire, Brigade service. In other words, by the addition of these three entries the Leo- islature has clearly indicated its intention that service in hospitals and dispensaries can be declared to be a public utility service under s. 2(n)(vi); and there is no doubt that unless the service in hospitals falls under s. 2(j) and is treated as an industry it cannot be declared to be a public utility service. It is true that this particular entry had not been included in the First Schedule at the time when the present reference wag made, but its subsequent inclusion can be reasonably taken as evidence of legislative intention, and, if on a construction of s. 2(j) we have independently reached the conclusion that service in hospitals is service or the conduct of hospitals is an undertaking, we may reasonably seek to derive corroboration to our conclusion by this subsequent legislative enactment,. After the addition of the relevant entry in the First Schedule it would not be open to anybody to suggest that service in hospitals does not fall under s. 2(j). It now remains to consider some of the decisions to which our attention was invited. In D. N. Banerji v. P. R. Mukherjee & Ors. (1), this Court was dealing with a a industrial dispute raised by the Municipal Workers\\' Union of the Budge Budge Municipality, on behalf of the Sanitary Inspector and Head Clerk of the said Municipality on the ground that the dismissal of the said two Municipal employees was unjustified and (1)[1953] S.C.R. 302.\\n\\nillegal, and that they were entitled to an order of reinstatement. The dispute thus referred to the Industrial Tribunal was decided in favour of the Union and an award was made directing the Municipality to reinstate the said two employees. The Municipality then took the matter to the High Court at Calcutta by means of a petition for a writ of certiorari under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution. It was urged in support of the petition that the Act was inapplicable to the dispute in question and that there was really no industrial dispute which could be validly referred to the Industrial Tribunal. Other contentions were also raised but it is unnecessary to refer to them. The High Court rejected all the pleas raised by the Municipality and dismissed the application for a writ. The Municipality then brought the dispute to this Court under Art. 132(1) of the Constitution. This Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the Municipality and confirmed the order of the High Court. In dealing with the appeal this Court laid down certain propositions which are relevant for our purpose in the present appeal. It was observed that \" in determining the meaning of the word \" industry \" and \" industrial dispute \" it was necessary to leave aside the original meaning attributed to the words in a simpler state of society; then the contention of the Municipality that its activities in question did not amount to an industry were dealt with in these words: \" The only ground on which one could say that what would amount to the carrying on of an industry if it is done by a private person ceases to be so if the same work is carried on by a local body like the Municipality is that in the latter there is nothing like the investment of any capital or the existence of a profit earning notice as there generally is in a business. But neither the one nor the other seems a sine qua non or necessary element in the modern conception of industry \". It is because of this positive decision that the appellant has fairly conceded in the course of the argument before us that the absence of the profit motive or of investment of capital would not make a material difference in determinig the character of an activity this court has also examined the other relevant factors pertaining to the construction of the word \" industry \" and industry dispute\" and has declared its decision thus; Having regard to the definitions found In our Act the aim or objective that the Legislature had in view and the nature, variety and range of disputes that occur between employers and employees, were forced to the conclusion that the definitions in our Act include also disputes that right arise between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be said to be analogy to the carrying out of a trade or business \". In the present appeal we have to decide the question as to \",hat attributes or features can be said to make an activity in question analogous to trade or business. Incidentally we may add that quite apart from the relevant considerations which we have already discussed it would be difficult to suggest that though the sanitary department of a local body is an undertaking under s. 2(j) a hospital run by a Government is not.\\n\\nThis decision has been referred to by this, Court in Baroda Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen (1), and it has been observed that it is now finally settled that a municipal undertaking of the nature with which the court was then concerned is an industry within the meaning of the definition of that word in s. 2(j) of the Act and that the expression\" industrial dispute \" in that Act includes disputes between municipalities and their employees in branches of work that can be regarded as analogous to the carrying on of a trade or business. In that case this Court was concerned with the claim for bonus made by the workmen of the Baroda Borough Municipality and it was rejected; comment has been made by learned counsel on some of the grounds accepted by this Court in support of its final decision, but in the present appeal we are not concerned with the claim for bonus and it is not necessary for us to refer to the said comment or to deal with it.\\n\\nSo far as the decisions of the Industrial Tribunals are concerned it appears that the Labour Appellate Tribunal has held as early as 1952 that a hospital is an undertaking within the meaning of s. 2(j). In (1)[1957] S.C.R. 33.\\n\\nSri Vishuddhananda Saraswathi Marwari Hospital v. Their Workmen (1) the, Labour Appellate Tribunal considered at length the policy and object of the Act, several judgments cited before it and came to the conclusion that the definition of industry in s. 2(j) was of wide amplitude and that there was no good reason for cutting down its natural meaning so as to limit its operation to profit-making enterprises only. It has not been suggested before us that this view has ever been doubted or dissented from in any subsequent industrial adjudication.\\n\\nIn judicial discussions about the scope and character of the concept of industry as it has developed in a modern democratic State the decision of the High Court of Australia in The Federated State School Teachers\\' Association of Australia And The State of Victoria& Ors (2), is generally cited. In that case, according to the majority decision it was held that the educational activities of the State carried on under the appropriate statutes and statutory regulations of each State relating to education did not constitute an industry with the meaning of s. 4 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 1904-1928 ; that the occupation of teachers so employed was riot an industrial occupation; and that the dispute which existed between the State and the teachers employed by them was therefore, not an industrial dispute within s. 51 (xxxv) of the Constitution. Isaacs J., however, struck an emphatic note of dissent, and the principles enunciated in this note of dissent have received approval from industrial tribunals in this country, and they have been rightly accepted by the Bombay High Court as affording valuable assistance in deciding the question in the present proceedings. Isaacs J. has uttered a note of caution that in dealing with industrial disputes industrial adjudicators must be conversant with the current knowledge on the subject and they should not ignore the constant currents of life, around them for otherwise it would introduce a serious infirmity in their approach. Dealing with the general characteristics of industrial enterprises the learned judge observed (1) [1952] II L.L.J. 327.\\n\\n(2) [1929] 4 C.L.R. 569.\\n\\nthat they contribute more or less to the general welfare of the community; and he has reiterated his earlier observations on the point in these words: \"Industrial disputes occur when in relation to operations in which capital and labour are contributed in co-operation for the satisfaction of human wants or desires, those engaged in co-operation dispute as to basis to be observed by the parties engaged, respecting either a share of the product or any other terms or conditions of their co-operation \". According to the learned judge, the question must always be decided by determing the true character of the activity in question. It is these tests which the High Court has applied in deciding the present dispute and we are in general agreement with the decision of the High Court. We ought to make it clear that in the present appeal we are not expressing any opinion on the question as to whether running an educational institution would be an industry under the Act; that question does not arise in the present proceedings.\\n\\nThere are two more decisions to which reference may be made before we part with this appeal. In Brij Mohan Bagaria And Chatterjee (N.C.) & Ors. (1), the Calcutta High Court was dealing with a dispute between an attorney of the court and some of his employees who bad been dismissed by him; and it was held that the said dispute was outside the purview of the Act. Sinha J., who heard the petition filed by the attorney, observed that \" however extended the meaning be given to the word industry or to industrial dispute or to undertaking or calling we cannot include within their concept the case of an individual who carries on a profession dependent upon its own intellectual skill \". The learned judge has then added that \" every case must be decided upon its own facts \". It appears that, according to the learned judge, if an attorney or a doctor or a lawyer who follows a liberal profession, the pursuit of which depends upon his own education, intellectual attainments and special equipment, engages employees, that would not mean that the employer is engaging in an industry under s. 2(j); but with the question of the attorney or doctor (1) (1958) 11 L.L.J. 190.\\n\\nor the lawyer we are not directly concerned in the present appeal. We have, however, referred to this decision because, in the course of discussion, the learned judge has expressed his dissent from the view taken by the Bombay High Court in regard to hospitals, and we wish to make it clear that, in our opinion, the criticism made by the learned judge against the inclusion of hospitals within s. 2(j) is not well-founded. Dealing with a similar case of an attorney, the Bombay High Court has taken the same view in National Union of Commercial Employees & Anr. And Meher (M.R.) & Ors. (Pereira Fazalbhoy & Co.) (1). We would accordingly bold that the High Court was right in holding that the dispute between the appellant and the respondents was an industrial dispute to which s. 251\\' of the Act applied. The order passed by the High Court on the writ petition filed by the respondents is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs.\\n\\nAppeal dismissed.\\n'"

They say the animals are considered a new species because of genetic, skeletal and tooth differences.\\nMichael Kruetzen is a geneticist with the University of Zurich who has studied the orangutans for several years.
